<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;South Africa desperately needs to encourage entrepreneurship as a means to addressing the country&rsquo;s job creation targets. A report issued by FNB and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) states that &ldquo;the most competitive nations are those that have the highest level of entrepreneurial activity.&rdquo;\n The Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) is a measurement of the percentage of the active population in a country (people aged between 25 and 64) who are entrepreneurs. According to International Entrepreneurship, South Africa&rsquo;s TEA in 2010 is 8.9%. This is higher than in previous years and significantly higher than our average TEA over the past decade: 6.7%. If South Africa wants to be a meaningful player in the global economy, we have to shape education, society and legislation to encourage, rather than stifle, entrepreneurship.\n Marc Benioff, the chairman and CEO of salesforce.com says &ldquo;Cloud computing has already spawned a significant number of new companies&hellip; In the coming decade, thanks to the proliferation of cloud services, ubiquitous, low-cost bandwidth, and cheaper access devices like smartphones, tablets, and netbooks, there are fewer obstacles than ever to turn an idea into a business.&rdquo;\n Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) represents a great opportunity for South African entrepreneurs. The much lower barriers to entry and simplicity of launching cloud-based services open up international markets to local businesses. This allows local businesses to generate revenue flows into the country.\n Analyst firm IDC expects the worldwide SaaS market to reach more than US$40 billion by 2014, while ABI Research expects the global market for hosted services to reach US$34 billion in 2012. This trend is reflected in the South African market where interest in SaaS is growing rapidly.\n Cloud services offer reliability, almost effortless scalability and substantial cost savings. However, South African hosting is not a competitive option. The largest local players are, quite simply, charging too much for services that can easily be sourced overseas at a much lower cost.\n How much lower?\n While the base fees charged for cloud hosting may be comparable, the real test of a service provider&rsquo;s offering is the data transfer costs on offer. Currently, data traffic for South African hosting options costs between R15 and R85 per GB (some charge more), depending on the level of service required. Foreign cloud service providers charge as little as R1 per GB (depending on the exchange rate) for data transfer.\n South African service providers simply can&rsquo;t compete with the cloud offerings of Rackspace, Microsoft Azure or Amazon EC2. It&rsquo;s a question of scale. Foreign cloud service providers can afford to build a much larger server farm because they have a potential pool of hundreds of thousands of customers. Because they have a much larger customer base, they can also charge each customer less. Local cloud service providers are forced to charge more because they have a smaller pool of potential customers, and are dependent on bandwidth providers that charge exorbitant prices.\n In our experience, the argument that local hosting is far quicker than foreign hosting does not hold water. As long as the foreign hosting site is chosen to capitalise on the new undersea cables, the average user will not notice any slow-down in service for software hosted on foreign servers.\n The Protection of Personal Information Bill (PPI) is another potential spanner in the works. The PPI Bill is intended to offer South Africans protection of their personal information, and places the onus on companies collecting such information to ensure that that information is collected with consent, and is stored and used in a secure and responsible manner.\n The PPI bill places stringent requirements on personal information that is sent outside of South Africa. If an entrepreneur chooses to use foreign hosting he has to ensure that:\n 1. The country the data will be stored in is subject to similar legislature as the PPI Bill in South Africa,\n 2. He has explicit consent from each of his customers to store their information outside of South Africa, and\n 3. The transfer of personal information is only done when it is necessary for him to deliver on the contract he has with his customer and is for the benefit of the customer.\n South African entrepreneurs should be able to focus on creating Value Added Services. Legislation such as the PPI Bill could force entrepreneurs to choose a far more expensive cloud service provider in order to simplify the contract and reduce risk. This is an unnecessary throttle on our development.\n &ldquo;The global information economy, including cloud computing, works best when information flows freely across borders in a responsible way with appropriate privacy and security protections. Efforts to lock data within a particular country or region will not only undermine the benefits of the global information economy, but also disadvantage local enterprises that want to take advantage of the tremendous cost, productivity, and innovation advantages that cloud computing enables,&rdquo; says Benioff.\n A South African entrepreneur who offers SaaS using cheaper, more reliable offshore hosting will be able to offer products at a lower cost. New businesses will be able to sell more products to more people and, in turn, will be able to grow his business more effectively. While I don&rsquo;t advocate for irresponsible use of personal data, I do feel that we need a legislative environment that is sensitive to the globalisation of IT that is taking place, and takes steps to make it easier for South Africans to benefit.\n Local cloud service providers face an uphill battle in their attempts to compete with foreign providers. To make matters worse, the PPI Bill is a step closer to protectionism that will shackle us to uneconomic, unreliable, expensive options when there is, literally, a world of possibilities out there for us to choose from.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="http://www.internationalentrepreneurship.com/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:490,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.internationalentrepreneurship.com/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:520}">

If an entrepreneur chooses to use foreign hosting he has to ensure that:<br />1. The country the data will be stored in is subject to similar legislature as the PPI Bill in South Africa,<br />2. He has explicit consent from each of his customers to store their information outside of South Africa, and<br />3. The transfer of personal information is only done when it is necessary for him to deliver on the contract he has with his customer and is for the benefit of the customer.<br />South African entrepreneurs should be able to focus on creating Value Added Services. Legislation such as the PPI Bill could force entrepreneurs to choose a far more expensive cloud service provider in order to simplify the contract and reduce risk. This is an unnecessary throttle on our development.<br />&ldquo;The global information economy, including cloud computing, works best when information flows freely across borders in a responsible way with appropriate privacy and security protections. Efforts to lock data within a particular country or region will not only undermine the benefits of the global information economy, but also disadvantage local enterprises that want to take advantage of the tremendous cost, productivity, and innovation advantages that cloud computing enables,&rdquo; says Benioff.<br />A South African entrepreneur who offers SaaS using cheaper, more reliable offshore hosting will be able to offer products at a lower cost. New businesses will be able to sell more products to more people and, in turn, will be able to grow his business more effectively. While I don&rsquo;t advocate for irresponsible use of personal data, I do feel that we need a legislative environment that is sensitive to the globalisation of IT that is taking place, and takes steps to make it easier for South Africans to benefit.<br />Local cloud service providers face an uphill battle in their attempts to compete with foreign providers. To make matters worse, the PPI Bill is a step closer to protectionism that will shackle us to uneconomic, unreliable, expensive options when there is, literally, a world of possibilities out there for us to choose from.</div>

If so, as a customer without technical know-how, how do you trust a software vendor to provide secure and trustworthy systems?\n\nEntelect Software takes a look at a few angles on this topic:\n\nVolume\n\nWith a rough estimate of the total number of active websites online as of March 2015 sitting at 1.2 billion &ndash; and the explosive growth seen over the past 5 years - the reason we see so much bad press is surely partly due to the sheer volume of public facing web presences being deployed into the wild.\n\nUltimately, the more websites we have, the more exposure there is, and there more news there will be of one or another organisation becoming a victim to web security related incidents. Given this vast web of information available via the internet, this volume also makes it an attractive target. Particularly with almost all developed-world banks having online services, and the spread of social and personal information online, it&rsquo;s hard not to stumble upon something valuable to somebody.\n\nMotive\n\nA second side to this debate, and often the one which frustrates consumers and organisations when they are the victim: why was I targeted?\n\nAccess or theft\n\nIn general, we think of security when we have something to protect - our cars, homes, possessions and, in the case of web applications, data. If your web system stores or processes data of value, such as payments, personal information, passwords or anything remotely confidential, then it needs to be protected. This information has value to somebody, so there is a clear motive here.\n\nIt&rsquo;s forgivable to think that your systems are safe because there is nothing stored within that is of value to anybody else, or where the data is all publicly available anyway. Unfortunately, there are still two remaining motive&rsquo;s that will take advantage of this thinking &ndash; vandalism, and infrastructure.\n\nVandalism\n\nVandalism of web sites is an unfortunate reality &ndash; where the motive is purely one of challenge, fun or an attempt to embarrass or expose the victim. Vandalism motives can range from inconvenience and petty meddling to full scale sabotage and ransom (seen in political and corporate breaches recently).\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure is a more interesting motive. In today&rsquo;s highly connected networks, there are often many more uses for server hardware than the systems or data hosted within. The most prominent one (when the data isn&rsquo;t the actual target) is to stage and execute more malicious attacks on other targeted victims. Using &lsquo;botnets&rsquo;, large numbers of compromised and synchronised servers or computers online, large scale attacks such as are possible\n\nMitigation\n\nThis paints quite a grisly picture, but there are answers to be found. The truth is, like many things in the Information Technology industry, there is a cost/benefit ratio to be considered for the approach to protection.\n\nUltimately there&rsquo;s nothing to be done about the volume of websites and the growth of the industry so there is little to be done to curb statistics that way. Looking at each motive, we can however start to position various possible protections.\n\nThe good news is that on one side of the spectrum is a mix of motive and risk that we can be proactive about. A staggering amount of web-based security breaches are perpetrated via automated tools or bots that are constantly scanning the web for vulnerabilities to exploit. These are, at any point in time, often only a handful of risks.\n\nKnowledge of these vulnerabilities equips a development team with the critical eye required to identify risks early, and close those gaps long before the system sees production. Since these vulnerabilities change fairly frequently &ndash; along with new technologies and tools &ndash; running once-off training courses or seminars rarely has lasting effects. It makes more sense to us to bake this awareness into the day to day development processes.\n\nAs a software development company, Entelect takes an integrated and active approach to security, we believe that awareness and visibility of these vulnerabilities throughout development, but especially at the start, are the most effective way to build secure systems. Building security into a web application after it is done, in our experience, is vastly more difficult, and costly, and less effective, than including it in from the ground up.\n\nA key resource we recommend to this end is the oWASP project. Found at https://www.owasp.org, this organisation is a non-profit with a mission &ldquo;to make software security visible, so that individuals and organizations worldwide can make informed decisions about true software security risks.&rdquo; Their yearly &lsquo;top-ten&rsquo; projects, in particular, help to identify and indicate the most prevalent security flaws, most of which are very easy to close, or at least provide the knowledge about them so as not to remain ignorant of the risks.\n\nThis is the more scary side of motive, and the one that most frequents the headlines &ndash; deliberate breach for theft of data. With the high end of the scale being the banks and financial institutions who are obvious targets for fraud and criminal activity.\n\nThe bad news is that highly organised and targeted attacks are often extremely difficult (read: costly) to detect or prevent. In this situation, if the organisational objective is to feel completely covered from any and all vulnerabilities, the capital and ongoing costs can quickly escalate. These costs are for specialised hardware, regular penetration testing and security audits, software development, and ongoing expert consulting.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear to us that security as part of Software Development is so important. Luckily, it&rsquo;s also quite straight forward to achieve thorough coverage. With only a relative minority of systems being deliberately and maliciously attacked, the remainder need to take more care. More care with learning, evaluating and mitigating web vulnerabilities, based on their chosen technologies. Awareness is critical &ndash; notably awareness of the current generation vulnerabilities that are being easily exploited through automated attacks. Secondly, remedial action applied early and often during development, to evaluate and close any vulnerabilities through technology or features will go a long way to taking your systems off a malicious user&rsquo;s radar.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;After speaking to various friends, family members and clients about the subject, it seems that very few South Africans consider careers in software development or information and communication technologies (ICT) when leaving school.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this, but first let&rsquo;s look at why a career in software should be given some consideration by this country&rsquo;s youth.\n\nIn 2014, Fortune&rsquo;s 100 Best Companies to Work For revealed that four of the top ten companies were software or technology-related organisations. In fact, the top two were both software companies. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t an indicator of the attractiveness of all software companies, but the &lsquo;Google-philosophy&rsquo; and Silicon Valley culture is certainly more prevalent in tech companies. On the local front, according to Career Junction&rsquo;s Index (July 2015), the ICT industry sees the highest job vacancy levels in the country. The demand for people to fill ICT roles is more than double that of the engineering industry, which has the third-highest demand level on the Index.\n\nIn addition, according to Buzz South Africa, the highest-paying job (on average) in SA in 2015 is that of a software engineer. This particular statistic is difficult to measure and differs from survey to survey, however, simply because of the demand for these skills, software engineers and developers will usually be in the top ten of any salary survey. Finally, in the biggest worldwide developer survey &ndash; StackOverflow&rsquo;s 2015 Developer Survey &ndash; around 70 percent of participants said that they were self-taught or trained on the job, indicating new levels of sustained value to employees presented by this field.\n\nSo, if ICT companies are usually good companies to work for, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find a job, an expensive and lengthy qualification is often not required and the pay is above average, why don&rsquo;t South Africans want to follow this path?\n\nAt present, the biggest reason is our backgrounds. A large percentage of this country&rsquo;s population grew up without computers. However, this is changing &ndash; smart device ownership is increasing and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see future generations take a greater interest in the software element of these devices. To add to this, renewed focus and commitment by public and private sector organisations to work towards improving South Africa&rsquo;s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) schooling performance is expected to yield positive results, which will also play a large part in making the ICT field more accessible for young people.\n\nThere is also a perceived lack of &lsquo;cool factor&rsquo; around the industry. However, software development is one of the few white-collar industries where employees can have the instant gratification of building something from scratch. With software being a part of everything nowadays - from apps on phones and devices, social media, as well as the process which runs a DSTV Explora or the SatNav in a car - software developers&rsquo; work is often showcased in the public eye. What could be cooler than that?\n\nIn comparison, the ICT industry is the largest private sector employer in India. India has a population of more than one billion people, and has embraced an industry that barely existed there twenty years ago. This has made the nation one of the most powerful ICT forces globally, and demand for the country&rsquo;s ICT services has driven significant economic development. African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria are also following suit.\n\nIn South Africa, the ICT market continues to expand, and the need for software professionals is clearly present. However, we currently just don&rsquo;t have people with the right skills to be able to meet this demand and play on the world ICT stage. If Indian can use this industry to boost their economy, why can&rsquo;t we, and why don&rsquo;t we?&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="http://buzzsouthafrica.com/career-choice-highest-paid-jobs-in-south-africa-2015/4/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:1081,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://buzzsouthafrica.com/career-choice-highest-paid-jobs-in-south-africa-2015/4/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1098}">

This particular statistic is difficult to measure and differs from survey to survey, however, simply because of the demand for these skills, software engineers and developers will usually be in the top ten of any salary survey. Finally, in the biggest worldwide developer survey &ndash; StackOverflow&rsquo;s 2015 Developer Survey &ndash; around 70 percent of participants said that they were self-taught or trained on the job, indicating new levels of sustained value to employees presented by this field.<br /><br />So, if ICT companies are usually good companies to work for, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find a job, an expensive and lengthy qualification is often not required and the pay is above average, why don&rsquo;t South Africans want to follow this path?<br /><br />At present, the biggest reason is our backgrounds. A large percentage of this country&rsquo;s population grew up without computers. However, this is changing &ndash; smart device ownership is increasing and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see future generations take a greater interest in the software element of these devices. To add to this, renewed focus and commitment by public and private sector organisations to work towards improving South Africa&rsquo;s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) schooling performance is expected to yield positive results, which will also play a large part in making the ICT field more accessible for young people.<br /><br />There is also a perceived lack of &lsquo;cool factor&rsquo; around the industry. However, software development is one of the few white-collar industries where employees can have the instant gratification of building something from scratch. With software being a part of everything nowadays - from apps on phones and devices, social media, as well as the process which runs a DSTV Explora or the SatNav in a car - software developers&rsquo; work is often showcased in the public eye. What could be cooler than that?<br /><br />In comparison, the ICT industry is the largest private sector employer in India. India has a population of more than one billion people, and has embraced an industry that barely existed there twenty years ago. This has made the nation one of the most powerful ICT forces globally, and demand for the country&rsquo;s ICT services has driven significant economic development. African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria are also following suit.<br /><br />In South Africa, the ICT market continues to expand, and the need for software professionals is clearly present. However, we currently just don&rsquo;t have people with the right skills to be able to meet this demand and play on the world ICT stage. If Indian can use this industry to boost their economy, why can&rsquo;t we, and why don&rsquo;t we?</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As consumers, we can all agree that this wave of market-disruption is a good thing. We all stand to benefit from this new model of engaging with traditional services. Right now, you can order a dry-cleaning pickup, schedule a dog grooming for your pooch, before catching an online-ordered taxi to the airport. Sitting in comfort during your journey you can live-trade on the stock market in your favourite shares (Go EasyEquities!). All these can be accomplished within a few minutes, with just a few clicks on your tablet or smartphone.\n\nPeople generally have a feeling of enjoyment when realising the benefits of using these disruptive apps, primarily because of the rapid response and instant-gratification that is now available.

So much so, &lsquo;Uber&rsquo; has become as much a buzzword as &lsquo;disruption&rsquo; at conferences (drink!).\n\nPersonally, I had previously never used a traditional metered taxi, besides when travelling in a first-world country where it is perceivably safer (cleaner) and I didn&rsquo;t have to carry any cash. The implication is clear: that not only are Uber-esque services directing business away from the traditional old-school businesses - disruption now looks to grab the attention of an audience that has never previously been serviced.\n\nFundamentally though, there is still an underlying problem with the older, mature businesses trying to disrupt their existing market. Their primary problem is a lack of speed. Traditional businesses are bogged down by slow processes, primarily in their procurement departments and within their supply chain management. The proverbial red-tape is preventing the necessary acceleration, movement and momentum that is required to disrupt a market.\n\nClient-facing disruption is now commonplace, expected and easy. To attain the necessary speed to get onto the wave, I think it&rsquo;s important for the older businesses to first direct the principles of this disruption movement inwards. Businesses need to challenge the way they operate internally. Starting with revamping their processes around purchasing, supplier management, payroll, HR (including recruitment and staff loyalty programmes) and ending with their actual operations: the day-to-day, business-as-usual, grind.\n\nBusinesses have to first internally disrupt to survive this rapid changing and rapid-response demand from a service-hungry consumer market.\n\nEntelect are often called in to reinvigorate an operational software-development environment. Our software expertise and years of experience afford us a unique opportunity to help a client embrace these changes. The easiest and quickest win is often the systemization of functions that could (and should) be automated and easier to use:\n  Are companies still using paper based leave and expense claim forms? Yes.\n Spreadsheets for sales tracking? Yes.\n Lengthy tender processes for research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives? Yes\n  \nThese are simple examples of operationally draining and costly exercises. These should be completed in a maximum of 3 clicks, in under 2 minutes.\n\nAlthough every client is different, I have on numerous occasions experienced a complete disconnect between the older, mature business processes, such as traditional procurement which don&rsquo;t fit the disruptive millennial &amp; on-demand services model. I acknowledge that the red-tape is important, but not always appropriate for modern disruptive services.\n\nThe up-and-coming workforce (and by extension younger consumer) is looking for something vastly different to the industrial age operating model. The next generation will help you in reinvigorating your business, and to do this it is vitally important to engage with your employees individually, understanding their goals and how best to utilise their strengths within, so it becomes mutually beneficial.Reward these employees immediately. Use your older knowledge to teach that building things right, the first time, is still relevant &ndash; but also use it to rebuild your business from the inside. Rebuild it with this generation&rsquo;s service-expectation model.\n\nEmbracing these new ways of operating a business is not easy. You might ask why fix the toaster that is not broken?

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As an organisation looking to use offshore software development companies, the emphasis needs to be on ensuring that there is some cost benefit without sacrificing quality. Some of the major factors in determining quality, centre around competency, track record and communication.\n  \n Competency\n  \n  The developers from the offshore organisation should be carefully vetted. It is worth interviewing a selection of developers and managers in person to obtain an understanding of the levels of competency of the developers\n The offshore company should be able to provide standards and technology guidelines, and must be willing to explain the methodology it uses and how it would adapt it for offshore projects, if necessary.\n Expertise in multiple software technologies is also important. Often if the company is very specialised in one technology set, it becomes difficult to diversify and use new or different technologies, which may be better suited to the task.\n   \n Track record\n  \n  The company&rsquo;s track record, credentials and references should also be scrutinised in order to understand the level of competency within the organisation.\n Look for a company that is big enough to do the job yet small enough to offer agility and to make the client important enough to receive prompt attention when it is needed.\n Your company&rsquo;s satisfaction should be a priority.

<div>As an organisation looking to use offshore software development companies, the emphasis needs to be on ensuring that there is some cost benefit without sacrificing quality. Some of the major factors in determining quality, centre around competency, track record and communication.<br /><br />Competency<br /><br />The developers from the offshore organisation should be carefully vetted. It is worth interviewing a selection of developers and managers in person to obtain an understanding of the levels of competency of the developers<br />The offshore company should be able to provide standards and technology guidelines, and must be willing to explain the methodology it uses and how it would adapt it for offshore projects, if necessary.<br />Expertise in multiple software technologies is also important. Often if the company is very specialised in one technology set, it becomes difficult to diversify and use new or different technologies, which may be better suited to the task.<br /><br />Track record<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s track record, credentials and references should also be scrutinised in order to understand the level of competency within the organisation.<br />Look for a company that is big enough to do the job yet small enough to offer agility and to make the client important enough to receive prompt attention when it is needed.<br />Your company&rsquo;s satisfaction should be a priority. A company that specialises in software development services (and not only offers software development as a small part of multiple other services) is also advisable. Many of these organisations do fall into the SME space, so SMEs are definitely a great option with this in mind.<br /><br />Communication<br /><br />Speak to as many people from the company as possible to gauge how the communication would work.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;There are several benefits that South Africa can offer over other offshore destinations or to organisations looking to offshore from the United States, Europe and Australia.\n  \n One of the main benefits is the financial gain. Typically, offshore locations such as South Africa, India and the Philippines have a lower cost of living than the United States, European and Australian markets and therefore, development resources are often cheaper in those countries. Obviously, cost-saving at the expense of quality is not recommended and this is the critical point.\n  \n Whether an organisation outsources software development to a local provider or an offshore provider, it still has to ensure those with whom it is dealing are capable of the task. Offshoring to a highly competent, professional software development company with a proven track record of delivery, and a team of developers who are highly qualified and experienced is the only way that an organisation can achieve the financial benefit associated with offshoring without sacrificing quality.\n  \n In most cases, to be successful, the software development process needs to be iterative with high levels of communication, trust and collaboration between a client and the provider. Thus the two major areas of concern when offshoring are communication and trust.\n  \n Although tools such as Slack, Skype and Google Hangouts have made global communication much easier, there can still be barriers around language and culture that hinder the success of a project. Working across different time zones and perhaps even to different working hours can exacerbate these problems.\n  \n In terms of trust, if a company can physically see its outsourced development team and can work directly with them, trust is built up quicker and collaboration becomes easier. Obviously, this is more difficult in an offshore model but there are measures an organisation can take to mitigate this and develop trust. These include talking to the development team members regularly and meeting with them in person before the project starts. Starting small is a good tactic &ndash; if the software company uses an agile approach, the engagement can be ended relatively quickly if that becomes necessary. Exploring references around how a company&rsquo;s software teams operate is also critical to building trust.\n  \n While there are many companies across the world to choose from, there are many advantages to utilising the world-class software developers and software development companies in South Africa.\n  \n On any project, cost is important and although South Africa&rsquo;s development resources are generally at a lower cost than others, this cost saving does not result in a lower level of service and output quality. While South African software development may be more expensive than that from India and other parts of Asia, there are a number of factors that still make it a stronger proposition in terms of the ability to deliver quality.\n  \n The business language in South Africa is English and thus communication problems associated with offshoring software development elsewhere do not apply. While in some countries companies often have to shield their developers from clients because of the language barrier, many South African software companies can have integrated technical and account management teams, where the whole team has strong enough business communications skills to deal with the client personally and obtain project information directly.\n  \n The South African business culture is also very Westernised in that it is similar to that found in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia. Proof of this lies in companies such as Entelect (www.entelect.co.za) whose offshore customers have all commented on the company&rsquo;s compatibility with their own work environments and cultures, as well as on the company&rsquo;s professionalism and ability to deliver complex technical solutions at a relatively low cost.\n  \n South Africans are resourceful and entrepreneurial, and South African developers generally thrive on solving business problems rather than producing code for the sake of it. They are usually willing to give input and challenge thinking and do not need detailed instructions to complete simple tasks. Generally, they are capable of communicating, showing initiative and taking responsibility. These are common issues associated with outsourcing to India (the most common offshore software development destination). A quick Google search on the topic indicates that there are some fundamental cultural differences that impede quality of service in Indian offshoring, primarily around developers there not showing initiative as a result of the country&rsquo;s more hierarchical and instructional culture. A by-product of this is lower attrition rates and better retention of knowledge.\n  \n South Africa has a relatively central time-zone (GMT+2) and therefore has some, if not most, of the work day overlapping with foreign markets. It also directly shares a working day with Western Europe. This means that communication delays are less impactful. The country also has a solid legal system that respects privacy and intellectual property rights.\n  \n With all these advantages, one would assume offshoring to South African software development companies is common practice. However, South Africa is not currently seen as the preferred software development destination. This may largely be because people outside of the country do not know that there is a great deal of software engineering talent in South Africa. An assumption is also made that in South Africa, and Africa in general, there is poor ICT infrastructure, which is no longer true.\n  \n In certain other areas, there is a &lsquo;tech bubble&rsquo; that has resulted in a vast number of people flooding the market as software developers and they are not qualified or trained well enough to develop software. Although South Africa does have a small talent pool, this is not necessarily a bad thing. In this case, a small market means high levels of specialisation and dedication to the craft. South African software developers usually have to be very good at what they do, to stay in the market.\n  \n A large part of why there is a skills shortage in South Africa is down to the country&rsquo;s history and demographics. However, the number of people enrolling in software-related courses at South African universities is increasing each year. There are also several local private-sector companies that are investing a lot of time, effort and money into further widening this pipeline through bursaries, scholarships and raising awareness around the industry.\n  \n There are many South African success stories and possibly the most notable example is that of software developer Mark Shuttleworth. Shuttleworth founded Thawte (one of the largest certificate authorities on the Internet) and Ubuntu (an open-source operating system). Another success story is Amazon Web Services&rsquo; Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which a team in South Africa under the leadership of Chris Pinkham and Chris Brown built. Sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest and Netflix all run on this technology. Amazon Web Services Q3 2015 revenue is listed as US$2.1 billion, and Amazon still retains a sizeable development team in South Africa.\n  \n Lesser-known success stories include WooThemes (a Wordpress toolkit) that turns over millions of dollars in revenue annually and Clicks2Customers, which is a digital marketing organisation based in Cape Town. It boasts Vinny Lingham, who is now CEO of Yola Inc., as its founder.\n  \n South Africa has also developed a number of technological enhancements over the years, such as the CT/CAT scan, the world&rsquo;s first digital laser, the full-body X-ray scanner, the speed gun used in sports (including cricket and tennis), APS therapy systems and computerised ticketing &ndash; all of which have significant software development components to them.\n  \n While there may be a reluctance to invest in South Africa, it should certainly not be as a result of a lack of technical ability, communication barriers or cultural differences. The success stories speak volumes in highlighting the immense talent found in the country&rsquo;s software development companies.&quot;}">

If you're an entrepreneur with all the passion for the business aspects of your new endeavour and the promise of the millions in profit driving you on, don&rsquo;t be deterred by the mammoth task that is software development - one of the most important elements of your venture.\n  \n Almost daily, our team is asked by individuals with grand ideas (ridiculous, novel or brilliant) on how to get started with a software-based business.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Six tips for a perfect outsourced software solution&quot;}">Six tips for a perfect outsourced software solution</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Unless you&rsquo;re a specialist in the field, developing the software required to power your latest visionary idea in-house is simply not an option. And so, lacking the time, money and skills required to get the job done, you will probably outsource the development to a specialist, thinking that your problems will be solved. But how can you be sure that you&rsquo;ll end up with exactly what you want&hellip; before you run out of money?!\n  \n Here are some tips that could help you to be one of those businesses:\n  \n 1. Stay true to your vision\n  \n Your vision sets out the reason that your project is important and defines its successful outcome. It is vital for each and every project to have a single, unified vision to keep it on track and ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction.\n  \n Remember, projects start out as novel ideas focused on results. But along the way, details tend to cloud the vision as more ideas come up and workarounds are implemented. Your vision is under constant threat of being forgotten as new, shinier paths open up ahead of you.\n  \n Don&rsquo;t go there! Your vision must be aggressively guarded and managed as it informs almost all decision making, including requirements, scope and budget. Your vision statement is one of the few things documented right at the start of a project. Be sure to promote and protect it throughout.\n  \n 2. Understand the requirements\n  \n Kicking off a project before your requirements are crystal clear is a certain path to disaster when outsourcing software development. As a general rule of thumb there are three critical attributes to consider when setting out the requirements for a software build.\n  \n &bull; Stability &ndash; How well do all parties understand the requirements? Are we all on the same page? Ultimately, this is an indication of how likely it is that requirements will change.\n  \n &bull; Criticality &ndash; Requirements with high criticality are the ones that the overall success of the system hinge on. Without these requirements achieved, the project cannot function. It takes great wisdom to realise not all requirements are critical, to truly pick out the primary elements of what success will mean. Achieving this balance across a set of requirements will lead to strong delivery wherever software is built.\n  \n &bull; Priority &ndash; Note that there is a difference between priority and criticality. Priority really means how important the requirement is to stakeholders. A requirement may not be critical to success, but could still be a stakeholder priority. Again, a balanced grading of priority across requirements will make for a fluid development process as high priority items are treated with respect, and low priority items are useful to be traded off when conflicts occur.\n  \n 3. Track progress smartly\n  \n Software markets and projects often move too quickly for documentation to be kept up to date in a meaningful way. Be sure that the tracking system you choose is able to keep up with the speed of progress on your project. Diagrams and models are often better than reams of text, but both are still open to multiple interpretations.\n This doesn&rsquo;t mean documentation is obsolete. When used in the appropriate context it could actually prompt us to be smarter about what we pen down. For example, slower changing information on a wiki can be hugely valuable, and remove key-person dependencies.\n  \n 4. Keep your team small\n  \n A common misconception is that adding bodies to a team can bring calendar dates forward. Doing this, ironically, actually slows delivery down.\n  \n Fred Brooks famously stated that &ldquo;nine women can&rsquo;t make a baby in one month.&rdquo; The truth is that while large teams are needed for broad projects where a level of parallelism can be achieved during development, communication is complex &ndash; so a larger team actually moves more slowly.\n  \n There is a careful cost:benefit ratio to be weighed up here, but the point to understand is that great software takes time. We often recommend that a client, instead of approaching a project with mindset of x resources over y months, use y resources over x months. Rarely is a few months&rsquo; delay (with no impact to total cost of project) going to dramatically change market reception. In fact, extending the launch actually provides more time to understand, process and polish software, usually resulting in a better end product.\n  \n 5. Understand the Agile methodology\n  \n Agile is a time-boxed and iterative approach to delivering software that works incrementally from the start instead of trying to deliver everything at once near the end of a project. If you&rsquo;re not using it, or recommending that your vendor use it, you should be. Scrum has already comfortably proven to be more effective than a traditional all-in, top-down approach.\n  \n 6. Be actively involved\n  \n Participate in the process. Outsourcing doesn&rsquo;t mean simply throwing your requirements over the fence and waiting for delivery. Outsourcing means you&rsquo;re using another team&rsquo;s expertise and knowledge, blending it with your own subject-matter understanding and, through this partnership, creating something truly mutually beneficial that perfectly meets the needs of your business.\n  \n  \n  \n At the end of the day, outsourcing should save you money and result in better products. After all, you&rsquo;re getting a team purpose-fit for expert software development to do it for you. It&rsquo;s important to bear in mind, however, that outsourcing software development isn&rsquo;t a fire-and-forget exercise. The businesses that are shaking up our markets with innovative solutions and products are the ones following an interactive, disciplined and participatory approach to building software.&quot;}">

But how can you be sure that you&rsquo;ll end up with exactly what you want&hellip; before you run out of money?!<br /><br />Here are some tips that could help you to be one of those businesses:<br /><br />1. Stay true to your vision<br /><br />Your vision sets out the reason that your project is important and defines its successful outcome. It is vital for each and every project to have a single, unified vision to keep it on track and ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction.<br /><br />Remember, projects start out as novel ideas focused on results. But along the way, details tend to cloud the vision as more ideas come up and workarounds are implemented. Your vision is under constant threat of being forgotten as new, shinier paths open up ahead of you.<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t go there! Your vision must be aggressively guarded and managed as it informs almost all decision making, including requirements, scope and budget. Your vision statement is one of the few things documented right at the start of a project. Be sure to promote and protect it throughout.<br /><br />2. Understand the requirements<br /><br />Kicking off a project before your requirements are crystal clear is a certain path to disaster when outsourcing software development. As a general rule of thumb there are three critical attributes to consider when setting out the requirements for a software build.<br /><br />&bull; Stability &ndash; How well do all parties understand the requirements? Are we all on the same page? Ultimately, this is an indication of how likely it is that requirements will change.<br /><br />&bull; Criticality &ndash; Requirements with high criticality are the ones that the overall success of the system hinge on. Without these requirements achieved, the project cannot function. It takes great wisdom to realise not all requirements are critical, to truly pick out the primary elements of what success will mean. Achieving this balance across a set of requirements will lead to strong delivery wherever software is built.<br /><br />&bull; Priority &ndash; Note that there is a difference between priority and criticality. Priority really means how important the requirement is to stakeholders. A requirement may not be critical to success, but could still be a stakeholder priority. Again, a balanced grading of priority across requirements will make for a fluid development process as high priority items are treated with respect, and low priority items are useful to be traded off when conflicts occur.<br /><br />3. Track progress smartly<br /><br />Software markets and projects often move too quickly for documentation to be kept up to date in a meaningful way. Be sure that the tracking system you choose is able to keep up with the speed of progress on your project. Diagrams and models are often better than reams of text, but both are still open to multiple interpretations.<br />This doesn&rsquo;t mean documentation is obsolete. When used in the appropriate context it could actually prompt us to be smarter about what we pen down. For example, slower changing information on a wiki can be hugely valuable, and remove key-person dependencies.<br /><br />4. Keep your team small<br /><br />A common misconception is that adding bodies to a team can bring calendar dates forward. Doing this, ironically, actually slows delivery down.<br /><br />Fred Brooks famously stated that &ldquo;nine women can&rsquo;t make a baby in one month.&rdquo; The truth is that while large teams are needed for broad projects where a level of parallelism can be achieved during development, communication is complex &ndash; so a larger team actually moves more slowly.<br /><br />There is a careful cost:benefit ratio to be weighed up here, but the point to understand is that great software takes time. We often recommend that a client, instead of approaching a project with mindset of x resources over y months, use y resources over x months. Rarely is a few months&rsquo; delay (with no impact to total cost of project) going to dramatically change market reception. In fact, extending the launch actually provides more time to understand, process and polish software, usually resulting in a better end product.<br /><br />5. Understand the Agile methodology<br /><br />Agile is a time-boxed and iterative approach to delivering software that works incrementally from the start instead of trying to deliver everything at once near the end of a project. If you&rsquo;re not using it, or recommending that your vendor use it, you should be. Scrum has already comfortably proven to be more effective than a traditional all-in, top-down approach.<br /><br />6. Be actively involved<br /><br />Participate in the process. Outsourcing doesn&rsquo;t mean simply throwing your requirements over the fence and waiting for delivery. Outsourcing means you&rsquo;re using another team&rsquo;s expertise and knowledge, blending it with your own subject-matter understanding and, through this partnership, creating something truly mutually beneficial that perfectly meets the needs of your business.<br /><br /><br /><br />At the end of the day, outsourcing should save you money and result in better products. After all, you&rsquo;re getting a team purpose-fit for expert software development to do it for you. It&rsquo;s important to bear in mind, however, that outsourcing software development isn&rsquo;t a fire-and-forget exercise. The businesses that are shaking up our markets with innovative solutions and products are the ones following an interactive, disciplined and participatory approach to building software.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;In today's software development environment, there are many teams that are capable of delivering and producing software. But there are also those who fail to meet the delivery requirements usually due to time or budget restrictions and which could be considered a failure.\n  \n There are various reasons that contribute to software development failures, recorded through empirical studies or anecdotal evidence. Some of these include poor requirements specification, scope creep, poor management, no user involvement, poor communication, or lack of testing.\n  \n Given that these are some of the factors that can negatively affect the success of the project, the theory suggests that if a project does not encounter any of the negative factors mentioned above, a project should be a success.\n  \n Someday in the future, it may be possible that all projects will be a success as we'd probably create an Artificial Intelligence to create software.

This has begged the question in my mind: what factors of a team contribute to a project's success?\n  \n Trying to answer this question led me to an overarching description of such teams - High Performance Teams (HPT). In my experience, a HPT is one with key attributes that contribute to a successful project. In real terms this means a team that presents the following five characteristics:\n  \n 1. Delivers continuously at a steady pace.\n 2. Displays a positive sentiment: They want to come to work, they are eager to make the project a success, they are eager to be part of the team, they have a sense of satisfaction from the work they do and they have a sense of purpose.\n 3. Eager and willing to contribute to the project and to the people around them.\n 4. Seeks every opportunity to improve their skills; either on a project and/or in their role as a leader, and finding ways to facilitate these opportunities while balancing delivery and making sure timelines are met.\n 5. Realizes the importance of mentorship and that team is only as strong as its weakest member: This creates a strong mentorship environment where the seniors are providing constant and regular feedback to juniors to improve themselves, and seniors in turn gain valuable experience with mentoring, which serves to position them as leaders within the team.\n  \n However, even with these five attributes in place, there are other operational features that can influence a project's success.\n  \n Empowerment and Decision-making\n A team that is afforded the ability to autonomously and pro-actively make decisions on project is key for several reasons.\n  \n Firstly, a HPT can action items immediately, items which would otherwise require several layers of approval. Typically, this is because they have a much closer view of the project at hand. As such, they are well suited to make key decisions on the project, since they are closest and understand the potential impacts better.\n  \n When it comes to problem solving, HPT teams define and identify the solution space and work within those boundaries. However, they are also not afraid to clarify or challenge the status quo, and due to their closeness to the project are able to think creatively about how to solve problems.\n  \n A HPT that is empowered often absorb high levels of responsibility and accountability. They take responsibility for their decisions, can justify their actions and decisions, and are not afraid to accept responsibility when things do not go as planned. Plus, they make sure that everyone accepts accountability for the roles.\n  \n In my experience, a successful component of this process is to recognize the efforts of the team holistically and/or individually and consistently provide direct feedback. Feedback ensures the team is always on the same page and can help to improve self-confidence within the team as a collaborative unit.\n  \n Furthermore, external factors such as unforeseen changes in the client team, or budget redactions, can present risks and limitations to the team's delivery. It is important that one member of the team keeps an eye on external factors to ensure that the team are able to continue to apply agile planning principles with relevant and necessary information.\n  \n There should be only one Head Chef in the Kitchen\n Having clear leadership within a team is important. In order for the HPT to make decisions with immediacy and based on accurate information of project and external factors, the team member fulfilling this role must consistently practice a number of leadership traits that serve to support the growth of the team:\n 1. Keep the end goal in mind and ensure the team is aware of the direction\n 2. Ensure that roles and responsibilities within the team are well understood\n 3. Continuously work to improve the skills of the team throughout the project\n 4. Presents regular status updates to the team\n 5.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Silicon Valley and technology hubs around the world have become incredibly good at fast, lean product development. And it makes sense to be lean and quick, given the high volume and low success rates that are features of the tech-startup industry. In contrast, older and more established businesses have their flags firmly planted in long-term expensive technology investments and practices that were relevant in the 1980s. The result can be predictable but slow and expensive progress.\n The tech-startup eco-system has driven the demand for fast-paced agile and lean software practices across the world in all areas of software engineering, and an incredible amount of innovation in software tooling and technology. The landscape is shifting constantly and so too are approaches to designing and building software systems, organizing teams, and managing deliveries. Netflix is a great example of this.\n To further illustrate the point: currently, there are more than 30 different major Javascript frameworks for web development, multiple cross-platform mobile frameworks which leverage different programming languages to build mobile applications, and of course their native counterparts.\n Outside of digital, we have an increasing number of languages available on the CLR and JVM for enterprise system development and growing popularity of alternative languages like Scala and Python. It&rsquo;s starting to make less and less sense to categorize our skills according to the classic platforms of Java and C#.\n As members of the corporate IT community, what does this mean for us moving forward? How do we make sure we&rsquo;re delivering against industry&rsquo;s best practices and leveraging the benefits of modern tools to stay competitive in our industry?\n  \n 1. A culture of &lsquo;continuous improvement&rsquo;\n We are on the steepest part of the technological innovation curve in human history. Change is more frequent, rapid and pervasive in our lives than ever before. According to a recent Deloitte university press report, the unit cost of computing-power between 1992 and 2012 came down by a factor of 3700. What cost R3000 then, costs 81c now (Deloitte, 2012). More importantly, they found that labour productivity growth flat lined while advances in core digital technologies sky-rocketed: exposing a clear innovation gap. Conclusion? We are not capitalizing on this innovation in software organisations. It&rsquo;s understandable. We&rsquo;d like to avoid becoming victims of the latest flavour of the month practice or technology, and we need to manage our risk responsibly. We also don&rsquo;t want a tendency toward risk-aversion to limit our potential as an organisation.\n Change is not something that comes easily to us in IT. We are by default attracted to certainty and predictability in most areas of our lives. Who can blame us, there is enormous complexity in what we do and as a result, a huge intellectual and emotional investment in &lsquo;getting it right&rsquo; once, let alone again and again. The data is clear though: change in approach, change in technology and change in people are all connected to our future success because change ensures we can constantly remain relevant and can meet our customers needs. While the tech industry has been somewhat successful at adopting agile approaches to manage our software delivery, we have yet to capitalize on being &lsquo;pro-change&rsquo; at an organisational level. Because change is expensive and change is intimidating. But when change is integrated into your business model, it can become a fluid part of your process, and consequently, much more cost-sensitive. LinkedIn is a great example of a company that believes wholeheartedly in continual learning.\n  \n Here are some headlines to think about, however each of these points is, in isolation, simultaneosly a brave and sizeable undertaking and a complete necessity.\n &bull; Foster a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration as a means to continuous learning growth (Harvard Business Review)\n &bull; Leverage popular agile practices to guide your software development process (McKinsey)\n &bull; Break down monolithic architectures and functional team barriers in the organisation\n &bull; Adopt a DevOps approach to reduce operational bottlenecks and speed up the shipping process\n &bull; Close the gap between business and IT and promote a culture of involvement from business partners (McKinsey)\n &bull; Engineer your solutions for change by leveraging modern architectural practices like microservices and containerisation\n  \n 2. Update the way you evaluate and seek talent\n If you&rsquo;re an organisation that values deep experience in specific technologies, then you suffer from the disadvantage of having people who are good at the past and (potentially) bad at the future. Adopt a priority of looking for ability, attitude and aptitude for change. Seek these traits out at the cost of all others, and you&rsquo;ll build teams who are constantly delivering work that is fresh and current.\n Accept that on-the-job training for any technology, tool and environment is part and parcel of your operational costs. Plan for it, embrace it and get really good at making it happen quickly. If we can build organisations that are resilient to high churn and operate efficiently despite it, we stand a greater chance at succeeding in the current climate. There are modern approaches designed to tackle this:\n &bull; Lean and fast recruitment processes &ndash; invest in shorter, less cumbersome and frictional interview processes.\n &bull; Smooth onboarding and orientation can help ramp up productivity and employee engagement (Harvard Business Review)\n &bull; Align with popular tools and technologies to access wider skill-pool, instead of niche products and technologies.\n &bull; Reduce setup time with pre-configured out-of-the-box development environments and tools\n &bull; Remuneration strategies that target shorter tenures &ndash; reward performance bravely and take into account market movements.\n &bull; Leverage software development partners for project-based, team-based or staff-augmentation work.\n  \n  \n 3. Start at the beginning: Adopt a low-hanging fruit approach\n Delivering solutions that meet your customers needs perfectly is at the heart of being competitive. Try out a feature-team approach on your next deliverable. Well-designed systems should allow you to ring-fence components and experiment with new technology in a way that lowers the risk of impact on the rest of your eco-system but allows you to make subtle changes to a client solution that keeps you ahead of your competitors. Start with the least critical systems and get comfortable, working your way deeper as you go. Start the conversations in your team and challenge your team to think outside of the box: what should we be doing differently?\n Trust your team, but contribute to the decision making process. Software engineers don&rsquo;t need to be architects or have 15 years of experience to bring good ideas to the table, you may find the best ideas coming from the graduate who joined your team 3 months ago. Encourage a culture of joint-accountability and continual learning and innovation - you&rsquo;ll find that change starts happening seamlessly and without prompt.\n  \n  \n 4. Structure that enable quick and collaborative decision-making\n Finally, bringing your entire team along for the journey is a non-negotiable. Change requires teams to be able to move quickly. Decentralize technical decision-making and invest in making technology and practice decisions as a team. If you can&rsquo;t build understanding and consensus in your teams due to structures that exist &ndash; break them down and start again. High performing teams don&rsquo;t necessarily need complete autonomy, but they do need trust and cohesion which are two things the old-guard has a poor track-record at fostering.\n  \n  \n As you build confidence in your new approaches, tools and technologies, you&rsquo;ll build an organisation who are not only resilient to change but thrive in it. A philosophy of continuous improvement will help you consistently deliver against industry best practices. As a result, staying compeititve will be the very nature of your business.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:2128,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/industry/technology/from-exponential-technologies-to-exponential-innovation.html&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:2142}{&quot;1&quot;:3934,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://hbr.org/2016/03/to-stay-relevant-your-company-and-employees-must-keep-learning&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:3957}{&quot;1&quot;:4039,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/an-operating-model-for-company-wide-agile-development&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4047}{&quot;1&quot;:4334,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/an-operating-model-for-company-wide-agile-development&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4342}{&quot;1&quot;:5538,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/03/technology-can-save-onboarding-from-itself&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:5561}">

Structure that enable quick and collaborative decision-making<br />Finally, bringing your entire team along for the journey is a non-negotiable. Change requires teams to be able to move quickly. Decentralize technical decision-making and invest in making technology and practice decisions as a team. If you can&rsquo;t build understanding and consensus in your teams due to structures that exist &ndash; break them down and start again. High performing teams don&rsquo;t necessarily need complete autonomy, but they do need trust and cohesion which are two things the old-guard has a poor track-record at fostering.<br /><br /><br />As you build confidence in your new approaches, tools and technologies, you&rsquo;ll build an organisation who are not only resilient to change but thrive in it. A philosophy of continuous improvement will help you consistently deliver against industry best practices. As a result, staying compeititve will be the very nature of your business.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Many external factors contribute to the success of software development teams. In a previous article, I discussed some characteristics of high-performance teams (HPTs).\n  \n These included:\n  Delivers continuously at a steady pace\n Displays a positive sentiment\n Is eager and willing to contribute to the success of the project and to the development of the people around them\n Values self-improvement and mentorship\n   \n I also spoke about operational features, such as team empowerment and strong leadership, which contribute to team success.\n  \n But there are other areas that have a pivotal impact on a team's success. These aspects are indicative traits and behaviors of some team members that eventually begin to rub off on other team members. Not everyone in a team needs to be a 'high flyer' or 'top developer'. Rather, a team should comprise a combination of people who want to learn and people who can teach.\n  \n The symbiotic nature of such teams leads to mutual benefit for all involved. Less experienced individuals who are eager to learn end up learning more, and improve along the way. The more experienced team members gain satisfaction from seeing those around them improve because of their teaching efforts. The overall team just gets better, works better as a cohesive unit, and delivers successful projects, regularly.\n  \n Apart from the factors noted above, there are a few other qualities that I believe stand out within high-performing teams. I call these the three C&rsquo;s: Craftmanship, communication and customer centricity.\n  \n Craftsmanship\n Software craftsmanship is an aspect in software development where coding skill is viewed as an alternative metaphor to engineering or science. It&rsquo;s the continuous effort to create a working prototype or a system and to iterate and make slight improvements to it over time. It&rsquo;s a very involved process that sees the craftsmen (i.e. the developers) invest heavily into what is being created. This includes copious amounts of energy, sheer will, determination and, above all, passion. It&rsquo;s not only about the actual code that is being written but also other aspects that are necessary to ensure the success of that code.\n  \n These include:\n  Understanding the domain better\n Improvement and establishing automated deployment processes\n Using the correct tool/language/library for the task at hand\n Engaging in tasks that improve the coding process\n   \n Software craftsmen are not afraid of feedback and actively seek out ways to improve themselves. They care about the result and is delivered to the customer.\n  \n Communication\n In any team-based environment, and in life, communication is a primary tool that we all need to interact with others and exchange information. This seems like common sense but it&rsquo;s often overlooked and not held in high regard in some team-based environments.\n  \n The above cartoon is typically used to describe common misunderstandings in a software project. It's quite poignant in that it shows how bad communication can lead to mismatched expectations at various levels of delivery. It also shows that communication gaps can occur within a single team, between teams and with the client (and other people).\n  \n To be fair, communication is difficult, especially when dealing with different people, across various skillsets, with different biases, different cultural backgrounds, varied levels of experience, and each with their own motives and objectives, languages, etc. This excludes the differences you may find when dealing with your customer!\n  \n Successful teams consider the above factors and build mutual respect. They work together towards a common goal but also all understand what the game is first. It involves upskilling people where required. Understanding and developing respect for your peers, is a group effort that everyone contributes to.\n  \n Externally though, when dealing with a customer, there is a tendency to over-communicate. I don't believe that over-communication has ever led to project failure. Over-communication should not be haphazard. There is planning and organisation and involves everyone in the team. Communication channels are established upfront, whether it is email, instant messaging or a spreadsheet. The point is that all parties involved agree on the channels of communication. Lastly, key contact people are defined as well the roles of everybody involved.\n  \n  \n Customer Centricity\n Typically, most developers create software for a paying customer: someone who is willing to commission the creation of a system or solution that will solve some business-related problem or give the customer a competitive edge. As developers, we need to keep that in mind as this plays an important part in the decisions we make and the impact of those decisions.\n  \n Firstly, customers should always get what they paid for. However, in most cases, what customers think they want and what they need can be two different things entirely. A critical part of a developer&rsquo;s role is to always try and create what the customer needs. This means that we must interact and communicate with them regularly.\n  \n Customers want working software that meets their needs. They have little consideration for how it was created. Developers want to create working software that makes a difference in someone's life. There is a clear relationship between the motives of the parties involved and this can be leveraged to enhance the product delivered to a customer. Simply put, if a developer can truly understand the customer, their needs and their expectations, a developer is better positioned to create software that has a higher probability of being used and making a difference.\n  \n  \n Mileage may vary for different teams, but there is a strong sense that craftsmanship, communication and customer centricity are basic ingredients for high-performance teams. Add some freedom, a bit of authority and autonomy and you&rsquo;ll have a great team in the making.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Consider the prevalence of technology in our lives and businesses today. Eventually, every business will be a technology business. The proliferation of technology has moved software out of being just a business support function, to one that can define a business&rsquo;s capability. This makes high-quality software pivotal to a business&rsquo;s success and means that every corporate in South Africa requires a significant software development workforce to remain relevant in today&rsquo;s market.\n  \n Shift to Agile\n  \n All CIOs are aware that quality software requires an organisation to follow an Agile development methodology. As a result, all IT divisions in the progressive corporates are fully committed to adopting Agile and are at various levels on their journeys. However, the fundamental issue with implementing Agile in a corporate is the necessity for full buy-in from the entire organisation. It is an organisational shift.\n  \n Corporate strategy evangelists promote the concept of &lsquo;alignment&rsquo;: how well an organisation is coordinated to achieve its goals. A central feature of any business strategy is the ability to effectively execute the core of the business while being able to adapt to trends and changes in the market.\n  \n Fit for purpose\n  \n Organisational alignment pulls together business strategies, organisational capabilities, resources and management systems &ndash; all of which need to be arranged to support the enterprise&rsquo;s purpose. It is not possible for the organisation to move quickly if it is not aligned and does not demonstrate &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; - the capacity to change to fit new circumstances quickly, and thereby remain competitive.\n  \n Similarly, an Agile methodology advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and rapid and flexible response to change. This is achieved through a culture of intellectual curiosity, collaboration, effective communication and always being ready to challenge the status quo. Importantly, it allows and requires teams to break from old habits before they become counterproductive.\n  \n Agile not just about software\n  \n Most business units embrace the flexibility that an Agile approach allows. However, the typical approach is to expose systems teams to barrages of training sessions to upskill those who present an obvious or immediate need. But what is often overlooked is that Agile development requires a culture shift across the entire organisation and the skills need to be applied more broadly than just the central software team.\n  \n Unfortunately, the standard modus operandi across most corporates today is that a business unit innovates a product in isolation, making commitments about delivery timelines with minimal systems input and then finally pushing the team for an unrealistic deadline.\n  \n This scenario plays out to different extents in various organisations. However, the result often is that it sustains any business siloes that may exist, deadlines are missed, or there is a mass exodus of developers at the end of the project, leaving the sentiment that Agile is bad.\n  \n Buy-in is key to success\n  \n Admittedly, much progress has been achieved across various organisations but the key point is that both systems and business teams need to be realistic about how delivery is managed and come up with a process that works in a corporate. Only when everyone - from the individual who first comes up with a product idea to the systems team - buys into changing the way they approach software development, will an organisation benefit from Agile development.\n  \n Often, &lsquo;pure&rsquo; Agile is not feasible in a corporate because expectations across senior management and exec level are always tied to budgets and defined deliverables, something that Agile struggles to represent. But communication - and the ability to communicate your project in a language that various business teams understand &ndash; is crucial to creating buy-in. Development managers typically have a spreadsheet that converts story points to hours so that they can report in a way the CFO appreciates, which helps.\n  \n Be agile about Agile\n  \n Therefore, Agile in various forms can work in a corporate, but one needs to be agile around implementing Agile. In the specific case of software&rsquo;s Agile methodology, often it is the organisational capability and resource architecture and management systems that prevent the organisation from being able to fully adopt and gain the full benefit of an Agile approach to software development.\n  \n An organisation that can transform to a truly Agile culture will recognise it needs to be complemented by strong and sound operational processes throughout all functional areas of the business.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The choice between custom software development versus an off-the-shelf product is an ongoing debate for start-up's, SMME's, and big corporates.\n  \n The conversation heats up when scaling comes into the frame and scope requirements become broader. Add to that an increasing user base, the ability to innovate, the need to adapt business offerings as the company grows, then the decision becomes even more complex.\n  \n Look at successful businesses. Firstly, what distinguish whether the business is successful? Is it one with an innovative and agile approach, or one with revolutionary products? What is the driving force behind this? Perhaps the software they use?\n  \n Customers have no knowledge on how a company&rsquo;s software operates, or if it is an off-the-shelf or custom development solution. The important thing is that the user experience is great, and the solution meets your needs and requirements as a business.\n  \n So how then, does a business decide whether they should be investing in a customized software solution or an off-the-shelf product?\n  \n  \n 5 factors to consider when deciding if a bespoke solution is right for you:\n  \n 1. Determine an accurate comparison for the cost. You need to look beyond the purchase price, but the whole-life costs (WLC).\n  \n 2. Some benefits, such as competitive advantage, are worth spending the time to get right. Although time to market is important, the pace of change determined by the market may mean you need to change and redirect your software development needs. Bespoke software takes longer to develop and structure than off-the-shelf products, but it aligns to your business needs. Designing the software correctly, enables agility and quicker turn-around time as the software grows and evolves.\n  \n 3. Bespoke seems riskier. While a solution built for 1000&rsquo;s of companies apparently presents less risk in terms of the functionality, the risk presents itself in application. Each company will use the package differently. Therefore, how relevant it is for your business will determine the risk in the long-run, especially if the pre-determined features cannot adapt to your business needs.\n  \n 4. There are so many software products out there, why go custom? Software products built for the masses are done so with the intent to spend the minimum development cost on changes needed. If the product covers 85% of the business needs out there it's good enough to be used in the market. 85% is the basic features that keep your business running. But, this means you&rsquo;re competing with the same tools. The innovation required that elevates you ahead of your competitors will be a custom build.\n  \n 5. The resources that a bespoke developer can spend on meeting my objectives are orders of magnitude lower than off-the-shelf products.\n  \n If you have analyzed each question, and are still not sure why bespoke software is better for your business, then you need to consider some aspects that may affect the future of your business more closely.\n  \n 5 reasons customized solutions will help you to future-proof your organization:\n  \n 1. With customized solutions, you only pay for what you need. Whereas, off-the-shelf software solutions cater for various needs of many businesses, meaning there are features and functions that you will never use.\n  \n 2. Using a tailored solution means you can satisfy your own business model, rather than that of a product. There will be times when you have to adjust features based on your business needs, or as your business grows. This results in you being at the mercy of the vendor to satisfy your needs.\n  \n 3. To meet your current and future business needs, customized solutions enable you to align the software to your own brand and specifically, it&rsquo;s market positioning.\n  \n 4. Applying a solution that is specific to your processes and people is central to your business structure and growth strategy.\n  \n 5. Customized solutions, for all the reasons above, enable your business to innovate from within and not be dependent on the product to slowly evolve.\n  \n In the last 5-10 years, much has changed in terms of software packages, open source and custom services that specialize in a single service only. Most of these are free or come at a low price. It integrates well into your software and simplifies the work for you.\n  \n Take Authentication for example: AuthO is a single sign on &amp; Token based authentication as a service. That means your authentication for your system or application is handled, managed and taken care of. There is no need to build your own. This allows you to focus on your business needs and build out the solution which fits your business.\n  \n Which option is right for your needs? \n  \n You should think carefully about your individual business requirements before making a choice, because you will need software that helps you achieve maximum results in line with your business strategy.\n  \n Bespoke applications can offer huge commercial and business benefits, giving you a competitive advantage.\n  \n If you find a professional with best practice standards who can develop the software,\n and meet your growing business needs by providing regular software updates, then a bespoke solution could be much more cost efficient in the long run.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;By Nico Mulder (Entelect, Delivery Manager)\n  \n This year is likely to be another revolutionary year in the enterprise software space. Underpinned by trends ranging from cognitive technologies to machine learning, we can expect to see businesses shift to building consumer-centric software solutions with an increased focus on user experience. Enterprises have started to recognise they can gain operational advantages from applying consumer offerings internally.\n  \n Typically, enterprise software development responds to software needs in a B2B environment, but this has constrained thinking for software innovation. While companies use technology trends such as chat bots to improve their external and consumer facing initiatives, they have overlooked the advantages these kinds of approaches can have on their internal operations.\n  \n As such, much of what we saw in 2017 will continue to progress; Agile development, Mobility and Custom software development. But two core driving forces behind these trends for 2018 will be the renewed focus on user experience within enterprises mimicking consumer offerings.\n  \n  \n Why enterprises will start to mimic consumer offerings\n  \n Until recently, CRM software was all pushed to the cloud, simply because it seemed to be the ideal environment for so much data. Companies were so focussed on their operations, they lost sight of the consumer side. But with more millennials coming into the workforce, this is changing. Millennials operate in a world where their entire lives are optimised. They expect this of their employers and working environments too. And importantly, companies have realised that applying more UX thinking to their enterprise solutions will improve operational efficiencies.\n  \n Enterprise Software used to dictate how the software works and the usability. It wasn&rsquo;t built for the end-user, but built to service the business and variances of a business process. The employee had to perform a job, and the software enabled them to do so, irrespective of the user experience.\n  \n In the past, business objectives driving consumer offerings have typically been; to improve customer experience, to optimize the user journey, or to optimise offerings to the customer. But companies are starting to ask the question &ndash; what if we apply this thinking to our employees and their operations? Suddenly the objectives become; to improve employee experience, to optimise the employee journey, or to optimise the offerings to the employee. This can all lead to improved internal efficiencies and productivity.\n  \n Consequently, businesses will start to create internal systems that not only reflect consumer offerings, but also have a high user experience factor, to enable quick adoption and improved productivity.\n  \n Mobile CRM platforms are a great example of the ways modern enterprise software is starting to mimic consumer offerings for operational advantages. Real-time collaboration on any device is becoming a more important for productivity. Most jobs require teamwork and communication and tools that enable this are going to put businesses at an advantage.\n  \n Unfortunately, while trends like Mobility are on the rise in terms of mimicking consumer offerings, it won&rsquo;t yet stretch as far as applied use of social media. In fact, social media within enterprise software hasn't taken off as much as one would like. Yes, corporates are improving their social interactions and employee experience within the company, but enterprise software doesn't yet leverage the impact and insights of social media as much as it can.\n  \n  \n So what are the technology trends that are going to underpin this shift for enterprises in 2018?\n  \n Agile, Digital Transformation within the corporate environment. This transformation is rapidly transforming and driving enterprise software towards consumerism. CIO's and CTO's are becoming more closely involved with the design of products and systems, ensuring the build and roll out is done within an Agile environment.\n  \n Less offshore development and more in-house capability and re-use of &lsquo;Software as a Service&rsquo; is starting to infiltrate and customize enterprise software.\n  \n Custom Software development for enterprise software. Replacing and moving away from off-the-shelf products, which require a high degree of integration and customization and don&rsquo;t focus on user experience.\n  \n Cognitive technologies focused on Product, Process, and Insight will have a massive spike in the user experience initiatives which haven&rsquo;t been adopted yet. Overall, Cognitive Technologies encourage a greater use of the existing services and streamline continuous feedback and information gathering.\n  \n Lower infrastructure costs achieved through more efficient utilization of IT resources, and an increase in capacity to handle peak demands. The use of Containerisation will definitely increase in 2018.\n  \n AI and Machine Learning will become a mandatory business aspect with the rise of chatbots and business bots automating various features and customer self-service portals. We&rsquo;ve already seen this in the past years but expect to see the trend continue in 2018.\n  \n Mobility will play a big factor in the enterprise software space, as the need to improve UX for employee productivity will be a necessity. Some businesses, in the agricultural and healthcare industries have started making this move, but in 2018, we can expect to see businesses in other industries such as automotive and short-term insurance, which will recognise the advantages of having a mobility solution built-in for their teams.\n  \n  \n Needless to say, 2018 will definitely be another groundbreaking year, trying to play catch up with renewed and improved technological companies.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;By Nico Mulder (Entelect Delivery Manager)\n  \n  \n Tele-working and Telecommuting are both popular thanks to technology tools that facilitate communication and collaboration. But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean both deliver the same results in terms of employee engagement and productivity.\n\nTelecommuting, also known as remote work, is when work is undertaken at a different location than the head office to reduce the commuting time. Tele-working is a working arrangement where employees do not commute or travel at all. Although the terms are used interchangeably, they are in fact two very different things.\n\nTelecommuting was first introduced in the early 1970's, when technology allowed linked satellite offices to connect to downtown mainframes through dumb terminals using telephone lines as a network bridge.\n \nThen, in the 1980's, the continued decrease in hardware costs and increased network speed has allowed employees to use computers to connect to their offices from the convenience of their own home. These days fibre to the home enables high-speed internet to the home, thereby facilitating conference calls, videos calls, and high-speed video streaming, furthering the potential for telecommuting.\n\nTechnology undoubtedly, has enabled working from home possible as it provides a platform to deliver fluent communication and collaboration of employees, for example:\n&bull; Skype\n&bull; WhatsApp - Groups\n&bull; Slack\n&bull; Email\n&bull; Video Conferencing Applications\n\n21st century digital work\n  \n From an employer's perspective, there are several benefits for a company to embrace telecommuting:\n  \n 1. Real-estate. A reduction in required desk space, in some instances as much as 40% of a workforce has been known to work remotely. That is nearly 40% of your employee costs.\n2. Autonomy and freedom. Giving your employees the freedom to work from their most productive space each day, and to enjoy the benefits of flexible working hours, feeds employee satisfaction and trust.\n3. Saving travel time. Employees who need to commute for long hours a day can be more productive if they can save unnecessary travel time.\n\nThere are several varieties of &lsquo;working from home&rsquo; structures:\n \n1. Work from home on a needs basis only: For instance, when the plumber needs to fix something, you are waiting for a package to be delivered to your house, or when the kids are sick.\n2. Work from home for 2-3 days of the week: A hybrid approach like this saves time on travel and commuting, but means the employee is available in the office for the other days of the week.\n3. Work from home, full-time: Also known as Tele-working. In this structure, the employee is only required to be in the office for meetings when video calls or conference calls aren&rsquo;t an option.\n \nTimes have changed. Tools for collaboration are in full swing\n \nIBM used to be a big supporter of the work from home initiative. In 2009 IBM boasted that 40% of its employee base didn't have an office. IBM, as a consultancy, advised their clients that working from home was a great initiative, and that leading by example was great for marketing. But by 2015 IBM rolled back on their decision to work from home. IBM's revenue had fallen 20 quarters in a row, and although IBM wanted to imitate a Google or Apple, neither Google nor Apple supported working from home to the extent that IBM had implemented.\n \nSimilarly, Yahoo reversed it's working from home policy in 2013 after the company had to cut their workforce by 2 000 employees due to financial troubles in 2012.\n  \n Facebook&rsquo;s approach was different. It focussed on driving collaboration and social engagement and so, created the world&rsquo;s largest open-plan offices. While flexibility remains crucial to the modern working style, Facebook recognised that human interaction and engagement was also important in getting things done and for creative thinking.\n  \n It&rsquo;s still about connecting with people\n  \n With technology available to make remote work faster, less expensive and more effective, the Facebook example shows that we don't connect with people just by being at your desk, we connect with people by talking to them. So this is where environments like the coffee machine and cafeteria work well. While technology enables virtual collaboration and communication, it is not entirely a replacement for human interaction. There are some things that we, as humans, essentially require to collaborate effectively. We call this collaborative efficiency, and its critical to effective teams.\n  \n Back in 1977, MIT professor Thomas J. Allen looked at communication patterns among scientists and engineers and found that the farther apart their desks were, the less likely they were to communicate. At the 30-meter mark, the likelihood of regular communication approached zero.\n\nThe automatic expectation has been that technology should improve communication and remove distance. But the study revealed that people use these tools to connect with people they see face-to-face as well.\n\nMichelle Peluso, IBM, Chief Marketing Officer believes that, \&quot;There is something about a team being more powerful, more impactful, more creative, and frankly hopefully having more fun when they shoulder to shoulder.\&quot;\n\nIn the working environment of today, employees are always working in teams. The lone worker has by in large fallen away. Now-days, employees in most industries, and especially in the software space, prefer to work in Agile team structures that are multi-disciplinary.\n  \n Creative problem solving, quick delivery, and the application of judgement on complex business situations requires employee interaction and sometimes, this can only be truly effective in an environment designed to support creative collaborative efficiency.\n  \n The intersection between flexible hours and team collaboration\n  \n Certainly the nature of work has changed. We will never return to a system where people all work a 9-5 day, based at the offce. But with that, companies have recognised the importance of collaboration. We can expect to see companies investing in developing intelligent working spaces that offer productive, collaborative, environments for their employees. Enabling them to jump into quick meetings, quick coffee catch-ups, and host interactive sessions for creative planning, when they are at the office.\n  \n There is the old saying...two heads are better than one. Collaborating in your teams is vital. There are smaller offices, and spaces where one can experience a quiet focused environment, but also collaborate and interact.\n  \n Equally, employees shouldn&rsquo;t see offices only as a place for meetings and companies should look at how they can create creative and collaborative working environments that add value.&quot;}">

According to Gartner, about 66% of leaders want to transform, but only about 11% are actually achieving a healthy dose of digital business. In your quest to Digitally Transform, questions such as &ldquo;Have we unlocked new digital ways of making money?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can we quantifiably differentiate the way to deliver value to our customers?&rdquo;. If you answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; to either, then your Digital Transformation journey continues.\nAs with anything new, it is always difficult to get things off the ground, to take that first step. This most certainly applies to Digital Transformation as organisations get stuck on their starting points. According to Gartner, 57% of organisations have yet to find a starting point on their Digital Transformation journey.\nHere are 4 points that CIOs can leverage on their journey to Digital Transformation.\n  \n  Connected \n  As they say, knowledge is power and as with any form of transformation, lessons learned or data accumulated is always key. How do you know where you&rsquo;re going if you don't know where you have come from? Connected is not a transformation per se but an exercise in laying the foundations for optimisation and data gathering initiatives.\nAs you connect all the assets that make up your business, therein lies the value to transform. From creating better efficiencies around delivery times and device utilisation or implementing technologies like IOT (Internet of things) to reduce costs. Once connected, organisations will be able to leverage the connections and data to open up new revenue streams from mining data or just exposing the data across the value chain for better correlations and efficiency.\n  \n  Autonomous \n  As we move into a world where machines become &lsquo;smarter&rsquo; with the likes of ML and AI, there exists many opportunities. From automating mundane human processes to complex AI scenarios, such as the use of drones for the security industry for facial recognition or perimeter and zone defence systems, the use cases are plentiful.\nJust as the machines make human efficiency better it is important to also note the converse. A machine is only as good as what it has been taught to do. With the rise of AI and machine learning, organisations can leverage these forms of autonomous technologies to gain competitive advantages, unlock new revenue streams or just cut costs with better efficiencies.\n  \n  Empowered\n  Organisations who empower their clients create exponential growth in terms of value-add. As an example, in the medical field, Apple&rsquo;s new series 4 watch has the ability to conduct an ECG (Electrocardiogram). This gives the user the pre-emptive ability to be aware of health-related heart conditions before it&rsquo;s too late. This not only saves lives but also medical costs.\nApple has empowered their consumers through the use of technology, giving them relevant information, thereby empowering them to be proactive instead of reactive.\n  \n  Programmable \n  For organisations that choose to go the programmable route as a starting point, it is important to note that business and operating model changes become a focus. The objective is to allow other parties to leverage your assets in order to deliver value to your organisation.\nThis is generally done by means of API&rsquo;s (application programming interfaces) that give 3rd parties the ability to unlock value from what you have exposed to them. Examples of this are banks which expose services through API&rsquo;s like charging for each call for digital identity verifications or bank account verifications.

There are many of these solutions still in service, but the number IT professionals who can understand and update the code dwindles as the modern workforce moves towards relevant and transferrable technology skillsets.\n3. Operating and maintaining legacy systems is costly\nThe cost of legacy technology maintenance, in the form of licensing and expensive specialised hardware, often outweighs the upgrade investment, even over shorter timeframes. The biggest cost risk is of course that of the potential failure of a legacy system and the resulting business losses.\n4.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The noteworthy impact design has had on software development in recent times has been indisputable. The market now is absolutely connected, and the network effect means that products with excellent user experiences will go viral, while bad user experiences will have the reverse negative effect.\n  \n On many of our projects, the amount of rework is reduced and the adoption of the product is increased when UX principles are applied. The entire software industry is under pressure to compete with the user-centric design approach of the major players, such as Facebook, Airbnb and Uber.\n  \n For many local organisations who do not have the generous budgets to match these big brands, adding UX Engineers to an agile delivery team does have a major impact.\n  \n  \n  \n At Entelect, we&rsquo;ve been delivering software solutions for close to two decades. We are guided by our many years as an implementation partner and understand that great UX is a result of a collective effort throughout research, design and development.\n  \n We have always cared about seeing our solutions go into production and get the adoption our clients had hoped for. This means we work to understand context, and challenge ideas with the intention to deliver something meaningful and create return on investment.\n  \n We also believe in looking beyond the technology, to business processes and other opportunities which may improve experiences or solve problems in smarter ways.\n  \n Great UX no longer just a nice-to-have layer added at the end of the development cycle, but a significant aspect embedded right from design phases to delivery. Over the last few years, we have been actively working to bring the voice of the user into software design.

<div>The noteworthy impact design has had on software development in recent times has been indisputable. The market now is absolutely connected, and the network effect means that products with excellent user experiences will go viral, while bad user experiences will have the reverse negative effect.<br /><br />On many of our projects, the amount of rework is reduced and the adoption of the product is increased when UX principles are applied. The entire software industry is under pressure to compete with the user-centric design approach of the major players, such as Facebook, Airbnb and Uber.<br /><br />For many local organisations who do not have the generous budgets to match these big brands, adding UX Engineers to an agile delivery team does have a major impact.<br /><br /><br /><br />At Entelect, we&rsquo;ve been delivering software solutions for close to two decades. We are guided by our many years as an implementation partner and understand that great UX is a result of a collective effort throughout research, design and development.<br /><br />We have always cared about seeing our solutions go into production and get the adoption our clients had hoped for. This means we work to understand context, and challenge ideas with the intention to deliver something meaningful and create return on investment.<br /><br />We also believe in looking beyond the technology, to business processes and other opportunities which may improve experiences or solve problems in smarter ways.<br /><br />Great UX no longer just a nice-to-have layer added at the end of the development cycle, but a significant aspect embedded right from design phases to delivery. Over the last few years, we have been actively working to bring the voice of the user into software design. We now take ownership throughout product development, and can take a deeper level of accountability than most. This allows us to deliver great solutions and give our customers a competitive advantage.<br /><br />Entelect is an end-to-end technology services provider delivering custom software across all industry sectors.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Best practices for building developer-friendly APIs&quot;}">Best practices for building developer-friendly APIs</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be among a company's greatest assets but can also be among their greatest liabilities. Poorly designed APIs lead to an endless queue of consequences followed by a bad reputation.\n  \n The API is an interface which software engineers use to interact with the data, and a well-crafted API just makes their lives that much easier. APIs allow fellow software engineers to create software to access and interact with your application. If your API is not robust, maintainable and developer-friendly, there is a risk of your API being used incorrectly or not used at all. The more consumer-friendly your API is, the more people can and will integrate with it.\n  \n Although you don&rsquo;t have complete control over what users do with your API, here are best practices for building developer-friendly APIs:\n  \n 1. Build your API using ubiquitous language\n \nDon&rsquo;t confuse your user by using inconsistent language across the different API calls and response formats. The API should reflect a single, uniform language used in the domain by the business &ndash; and hopefully the industry as well. For example, avoid a response &lsquo;transaction&rsquo; in one instance and 'order&rsquo; in another when referring to the same entity.\n \nWhen building your API, take the principle of least astonishment, also called the principle of least surprise, into account. The principle states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; hence the behaviour should not astonish, confuse or surprise the API consumers.\n \n\n2. Understand your audience\n \nKnowing who your target audience is can refine both API functionality and segment future integration possibilities. Your API needs to have real-world use cases and should not be built based on assumptions of what your audience would want. Build for an existing need, and if you don&rsquo;t have one, do the market research by speaking to relevant stakeholders. Leverage user feedback, and test and consume your API yourself.\n \n\n3. Chatty vs. chunky APIs\n \nOne of the challenges of building any API is designing your it in such a way that is both useable for a wide variety of consumers, but also with minimal overhead, understanding and effort required to perform an operation. An API&rsquo;s design can either be described as &ldquo;chatty&rdquo; or &ldquo;chunky&rdquo;, which refers to amount of calls the API requires for a single logical operation.\n \n&bull; Chatty APIs require you to have to do multiple calls to perform a single operation. Chatty APIs are often not favoured because requiring multiple network calls will slow down an application&rsquo;s responsiveness. You also need to have the knowledge of what to call, when. An example of a chatty API would be if you need to collect resources for a section in web application, it might force you to get needed info for each object separately.\n \n&bull; Chunky APIs include more information in the payloads and do more with single calls. A chunky API will create are fewer calls, but can do more, or return more information. Of course, there are limits to how chunky it should be. With chunky APIs, there is less flexibility for the consumers, resulting in less possible variety in use of the API. Overly prescriptive results in less creativity.\n \nBoth have their advantages and limitations, and a balance should be found between the two &ndash; depending on the requirements of your API.\n  \n  \n \n\n\n4. Design with performance in mind\n \nIt&rsquo;s important to define the time and payload size limits of each API call so that consumers know what performance to expect from each call. However, be careful not to over-optimise. Design with performance in mind, but the design should not focus on performance only. You would still need to be mindful of the API usability and maintainability.\n\nYou would need to adequately test the API and incorporate automated testing to ensure that non-functional requirements are met. The tests should be representative of the production usage and load, e.g. databases should be representative of production data, the number of calls and distribution thereof should mimic expected usage.\n \n\n5. Enable clear error reporting \n \nError or status codes are almost the last thing that you want to see in an API response. However, using correct error codes is extremely valuable to the consumer of your API, and beneficial to your development team. Error responses should have the right level of detail of what went wrong and should send the necessary information back to API consumer. With a simple error code and resolution explanation, you&rsquo;ve not only communicated the cause of the error, but the intended functionality and method to fix said error.\n \nUtilise features of the technology protocols rather than using custom error reporting, e.g. apply HTTP response codes when using HTTP protocol according to level 2 of the Richardson Maturity Model for RESTful interfaces.\n \n \n6. API documentation\n \nYour API should be accompanied by good documentation and should give your consumer guidelines on various aspects, such as expected response times. It needs to explain the domain and its ubiquitous language where the API cannot, including providing high-level context to piece things together. Using diagrams for this often helps. Following these guidelines should eliminate any ambiguity of certain terms used in the ubiquitous language, such as the 'transaction&rsquo; versus &lsquo;order&rsquo; instance.\n  \n In general, an effective API design would be easy to read and work with, hard to misuse, and would be complete and concise. As the saying goes, &ldquo;A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it&rsquo;s not that good.&rdquo;&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Traditionally one of the most common understandings of what the software engineers do on a development team is that they are individuals that turn caffeine and pizza into code. While this usually gets a giggle or two, it is obviously not the whole picture. The fact of the matter is that when it comes to understanding what developers do, very few people can empathise with the &ldquo;coders&rdquo; on a team and the role they play in the development process.\n  \n  \n \n\nOver many years in various parts of the software industry, I&rsquo;ve started seeing and appreciating the similarities between the creation of a piece of software and the creation of a piece of art &ndash; and to that end, I would like to propose an analogy between the two. I&rsquo;m a believer that everyone on a software development team is a developer. Whether you test, design or write code, you are part of the development process, and therefore you are a developer. However, for the sake of the analogy, I&rsquo;ll be referring to the coders or software engineers on the team as developers.\n \nThe software development life cycle (SDLC) has many facets to it, but the basic gist of it is that software exists to solve a need a user may have. Most people in the industry would agree that there is a basic flow across all methodologies.\n \nFirst, the user&rsquo;s need should be identified. Their need may be based on existing software, it may be a new feature, or it may be a need that they or the world don&rsquo;t even know they have yet.\n \nSecondly, a solution needs to be designed to meet the user&rsquo;s need. At this point, there are many people involved, such as the user, some sort of design element and the engineering team. Whether they brainstorm, story map, use design thinking or just chat around a whiteboard; the point is there is a collaborative effort to design a solution to solve the need.\n \nAfter the solution has been designed, something needs to be built. This leads into some form of engineering phase. This is where the developers code the actual implementation of the solution.\n \nOnce the engineering is done, there is a testing phase with a little to and fro with the engineering phase to ensure the solution is viable and works as expected.\n \nAfter everyone is happy with the testing outcomes the software is handed over to the user.\n \nMost people will agree, that this process is more or less the same irrespective of the methodology you use to support your SDLC. The actual methodology is irrelevant. The intention of this article isn&rsquo;t necessarily to explain the SDLC, instead, to build an analogy between the engineering phase and the creation of a piece of art.\n \nWhat makes up art?\n \nLet&rsquo;s use a painting. Broadly speaking, there is some sort of canvas for the artist to work with. The artist has access to various types of brushes, and is skilled in making use of different strokes and techniques to visualise their envisioned image onto the canvas.\n \nTo create the painting, artists mix colours to create new ones, they test different strokes and brushes create different effects to put everything together to create a piece of art. They experiment and explore to get to their final work of art.\n \nWhether it&rsquo;s spray paint and a wall, watercolours on paper, or oil paint on a cloth; an image is formed for someone else to enjoy.\n \nWhat makes up software?\n \nSoftware is very much like an ogre &ndash; and no I don&rsquo;t mean ugly like an ogre. Or at least I hope not! Everyone should be creating beautiful software for your users. But, by now, everyone should know that ogres are like onions. Onions have layers, and just as onions and ogres have layers, software has layers too. There are many aspects to a piece of software over and above what the user sees and experiences. The developers and the architects reading this may argue that it&rsquo;s not as simple, and they are 100% correct, but this is the crux of what I need for my analogy.\n  \n  \n At the top there is a user interface (UI) layer. This is the layer where the user can see information or enter data, and where they touch, slide, click and scroll.

This layer does the number crunching and deciphers what to feed back to the user. The user interacts with this layer through a user interface. The last layer is where data is persisted for later use.\n \nIn these layers, there are many tools. These tools range from the languages we use such as C# or Java, constructs in these languages, and the ifs and loops to help with flow control &ndash; algorithms we have learnt. There are all sorts of frameworks, platforms and integrations at our disposal to solve problems and meet the needs of our users. These are very much like our colours, brushes, techniques and canvases all used to form something useful for a user to enjoy.\n \nThe engineering\n \nThe process until now has been focused on creating something that meets the user&rsquo;s needs, but the engineering phase is where the developers must solve the problems that were created by the solution. For most people, this part of the lifecycle is a black hole, and this is where I want to pause to connect the analogy to a piece of art. Much like the artists, the engineers need to sit down and use their tools, mix and match, experiment and explore to implement the desired solution.\n \nThere is no one way to approach these problems &ndash; the possibilities are endless. This is where c creativity needs to flow. To build on to the analogy, each developer (and team for that matter) will also have a unique way of using the tools to come up with a solution.\n \nIf you are a developer, you walk out of the story mapping, design thinking session or whichever collaborative exercise your team uses, with a whole cacophony of ideas. While we are one step closer to creating something that meets the users&rsquo; needs, we have now just created a whole lot of problems for the engineers.\n \nOur tools may be technical, and our problems may be technical, but we need to get creative when putting it all together in a solution.\n \nAs Vasco Duarte said about knowledge work, &ldquo;It is in doing the work that we discover the work that needs to be done&rdquo;. Let that sink in for a moment. Even though we already have a solution, there is a whole lot of discovery that needs to take place to turn it into a final software product.\n \nMy intent isn&rsquo;t necessarily to provide a checklist to solve this matter, but rather to create awareness for possible communication barriers within the SDLC that need to be overcome. A great place to start is to visualise. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.\n  \n  \n \n\nThe intention is, however, to create a bit of empathy for the engineers and what they do after a solution has been designed. At the end of the day, someone needs to solve the problems created by the solution. Thus, my question to you is: &ldquo;But is it art?&rdquo;&quot;}">
<div>
<div>Traditionally one of the most common understandings of what the software engineers do on a development team is that they are individuals that turn caffeine and pizza into code. While this usually gets a giggle or two, it is obviously not the whole picture. The fact of the matter is that when it comes to understanding what developers do, very few people can empathise with the &ldquo;coders&rdquo; on a team and the role they play in the development process.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Over many years in various parts of the software industry, I&rsquo;ve started seeing and appreciating the similarities between the creation of a piece of software and the creation of a piece of art &ndash; and to that end, I would like to propose an analogy between the two. I&rsquo;m a believer that everyone on a software development team is a developer. Whether you test, design or write code, you are part of the development process, and therefore you are a developer. However, for the sake of the analogy, I&rsquo;ll be referring to the coders or software engineers on the team as developers.<br /><br />The software development life cycle (SDLC) has many facets to it, but the basic gist of it is that software exists to solve a need a user may have. Most people in the industry would agree that there is a basic flow across all methodologies.<br /><br />First, the user&rsquo;s need should be identified. Their need may be based on existing software, it may be a new feature, or it may be a need that they or the world don&rsquo;t even know they have yet.<br /><br />Secondly, a solution needs to be designed to meet the user&rsquo;s need. At this point, there are many people involved, such as the user, some sort of design element and the engineering team. Whether they brainstorm, story map, use design thinking or just chat around a whiteboard; the point is there is a collaborative effort to design a solution to solve the need.<br /><br />After the solution has been designed, something needs to be built. This leads into some form of engineering phase. This is where the developers code the actual implementation of the solution.<br /><br />Once the engineering is done, there is a testing phase with a little to and fro with the engineering phase to ensure the solution is viable and works as expected.<br /><br />After everyone is happy with the testing outcomes the software is handed over to the user.<br /><br />Most people will agree, that this process is more or less the same irrespective of the methodology you use to support your SDLC.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;7 business and technology trends to look out for in 2020&quot;}">7 business and technology trends to look out for in 2020</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Over the past decade, buzzwords like &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; and &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; were all the hype, along with some curiosity and confusion around the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The big question for businesses moving into 2020 is how to start leveraging these disruptive technology and business trends.\n  \n There are clear indicators that trends like automation, cloud strategies and leveraging data will continue to be utilised by organisations throughout the coming decade. These and a few others make up the 7 business and technology trends to look out for in 2020:\n  \n 1. Data-driven decision making\n \nData-driven decision making (DDDM) is the process of making organisational decisions based on actual data rather than intuition or observation alone. Organisations will better leverage historic data, operational data, and usage data to guide strategic decisions. However, having vast amounts of data at your disposal is not the advantage, but rather how it&rsquo;s being leveraged. Data is only as valuable as the insights you can draw from it, and with all the information that&rsquo;s floating about, it&rsquo;s easy to find yourself being led astray. Businesses that will truly benefit from DDDM are the ones who have effective data strategies in place, target data according to business objectives, and turn insights into action.\n  \n 2. Automation for elevated job functions\n \nAutomation has been widely discussed over the last decade. Moving forward, automation will be introduced into large organisations to eliminate menial work. This won&rsquo;t necessarily lead to job losses, but the aim would rather be to free up employees to perform more meaningful tasks, such as improving customer experience and offering tactical decision making in operational work. Organisations leveraging automation will significantly reduce time spent on manual, repetitive work and cut down on human error.\n  \n 3. An increase in instant apps and progressive web apps (PWAs)\n \nMore people than ever before are online and the ways they&rsquo;re accessing the web are ever-changing. Mobile usage is surpassing desktop and the trend will only continue, as more people around the globe primarily use mobile devices to access the internet through mobile websites and apps. That being said, the need for bulky mobile applications will diminish, and organisations will opt for leaner, cheaper and more versatile instant applications and web applications that look and feel like native apps in the coming years. In future, fully fledged mobile app offerings will mainly be for flagship products where there can be no compromise on user experience.\n  \n 4. Cloud adoption and utilisation\n \nAlthough there has been mass adoption of cloud technologies over the last few years, it has mainly been centred around replicating on-premises bare metal architectures on the cloud. Organisations will now better harness the services and solutions available on cloud for improved delivery, reliability, scale, and cost. Altogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits. Cloud technologies alleviate complex processes for getting software in the hands of customers, allow for rapid development and testing of hypothesis, and provide more reliability in serving products and services.\n  \n 5. Digital twins and simulating the business\n \nOrganisations will realise the opportunity in modelling their business digitally and utilising data to adjust operations on an almost real-time basis. This will allow businesses to improve ongoing processes, train employees, and test new products or services before launching them to the real world, where it becomes more expensive and complicated to fix issues.\n  \n 6. Microservices and micro apps\n \nSimilar to microservices, micro apps provide highly focused, task-based functionality that let users get in, interact, and get out with maximum efficiency. Both microservices and micro apps are meant to be lightweight, and the concepts hold great importance for enterprise mobility strategies. As we&rsquo;re moving more and more towards the world of &ldquo;micro&rdquo;, organisations will embrace building focused, lean, and well-defined applications over large scale applications that do too much. This allows for validating assumptions and business models with quicker feedback loops.\n  \n 7. Growing stronger teams through collaboration\n \nThe final business trend worth addressing is that of breaking down silos through collaboration. Organisations will begin to place more emphasis on growing stronger teams versus stronger individuals. Instead of business units working independently, teams with different goals but the same vision will start working more tightly together. These stronger, more agile teams will break out of the traditional ways of work to a more collaborative, lean and aligned way of work.\n  \n 2020 is filled with great business opportunity and challenges for organisations to become more efficient, elevate their customer experience, and offer effective products and services. This will be accomplished by leveraging technology, critical evaluation of strategic goals, and evolving working culture for a new age. These seven trends are guiding principles that can help make this a reality.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;There&rsquo;s a new generation of customers. Customers who are more informed, more experienced and more digital. And they&rsquo;re not answering your calls anymore.\n  \n If your organisation is still one of the few who only communicate with customers via a call centre, you are alienating a large portion of potential clients. The State of Global Customer Service Report by Microsoft showcased the rising expectations of digitally empowered customers. According to the report, 74% of customers aged between 18-34 have a more favourable view of brands that respond to customer service questions or complaints on social media, and 79% of customers in that age group prefer brands that offer a mobile-responsive customer service support portal. A surprising and sobering statistic for many large, traditional businesses.\n  \n But it&rsquo;s not only technologically savvy Millennials who prefer engaging over digital mediums. 66% of global respondents of all ages stated that they prefer omni-channel services and actively use at least 3 channels to engage with businesses &ndash; a blind spot that is often overlooked by brands.\n  \n Despite these statistics, organisations have always been led to believe that customers prefer a more personal approach &ndash; hence the investment in call centres and phone calls. But not all transactions need to be personal. Let&rsquo;s take the customer journey of buying a car as an example. Digital customers do all their research online and are often more informed than the sales representatives or call centre agents who contact them. When buying a car, they have done all the research and have essentially already made up their minds by the time they send through an enquiry. The only thing that the agent can really do at that point is talk the potential customer out of a sale.\n  \n Chances are, when a customer sends through a product enquiry, they have sent that same request to your competitors, and receiving call-backs on every enquiry instead of an online response on the digital medium they used is disruptive. Then there&rsquo;s also the added frustrations of trying to spell out their name and address to the agent over the phone, dealing with agents who aren&rsquo;t informed enough to deal with their questions, and having to repeat information over and over again while being transferred from agent to agent.\n  \n  \n  \n Where to from here?\n \nIt&rsquo;s clear that customers are becoming more digital by the year and it&rsquo;s often difficult to keep up with constantly-evolving trends. The world&rsquo;s largest messenger apps &ndash; WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger &ndash; had a combined user base of over 4 billion at the end of 2019. The value in engaging, serving and selling to customers on these platforms is monumental.\n  \n Organisations who don&rsquo;t have effective omni-channel strategies in place; inclusive of email comms, live chat functionality, instant messaging and call centres, are the ones stuck with a blind spot of customers they&rsquo;ll never reach. These customers won&rsquo;t complain about the lack of communication channels, but would rather move on to the next best service provider. Avoid these blind spots by asking your customers how they prefer to be contacted and taking active steps to offer more digital ways to engage with your products.\n  \n The truth is, a big portion of customers do still prefer the personal connection that phone calls offer and they should not be ignored. But in a digital world, alienating an entire generation of digital-only customers is dangerous when your competitors are always at their fingertips.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Overcoming human irrationality with UX&quot;}">Overcoming human irrationality with UX</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Overcoming human irrationality with UX\n  \n &ldquo;Forget about your competitors, just focus on your customers.&rdquo; This seems like a simple-yet-bold statement by Alibaba co-founder, Jack Ma. But do we as organisations really know our customers? Or do we just think that we do?\n  \n We often believe that our customers are rational thinkers that make decisions based on what is best for them. However, it has often been proven that humans are irrational beings, often making decisions that are not based on facts or data, but rather on what makes them feel good. This is because humans are inherently emotional beings.\n  \n &ldquo;Our thinking is riddled with systematic mistakes known to psychologists as cognitive biases. And they affect everything we do. They make us spend impulsively, be overly influenced by what other people think. They affect our beliefs, our opinions and our decisions, and we have no idea it is happening.&rdquo; &ndash; Toby Macdonald\n  \n Taking users&rsquo; emotions and attitudes into account, user experience (UX) engineering is the process used to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.\nIf we look at this from a psychological aspect, it means addressing the clear drivers and blockers that contribute to why a user behaves towards a particular stimulus.\n  \n Below are 2 short case studies on how companies relied on UX principles to understand human irrationality:\n  \n 1. The optimal level of challenge \n \nDuring the 1950s, General Mills food company released a branded, do-it-yourself cake mix. Each box contained all the ingredients required to bake the cake; packaged as a packet of dry ingredients, which included milk and eggs. All that was needed to bake the cake was to line a cake tin, add water to the mix and place the batter into the oven.\n  \n When the product didn&rsquo;t sell General Mills decided to bring in a team of psychologists to determine why this was the case. They discovered that the targeted users believed that it was just too easy. They couldn&rsquo;t impress anyone with their cooking skills, as it felt like they were cheating.\n  \n The company then decided to complicate the product slightly by adding in a single step to the process; to &ldquo;add an egg'&rdquo;. They relaunched the product and sales went through the roof, turning the negative user emotion of &rsquo;cheating&rsquo; into the positive emotion of &rsquo;participation&rsquo; in the process.\n  \n Part of this can be attributed to the optimal level of challenge. The framework states that if something is too easy, it causes negative emotions due to boredom. It also states that if something is too challenging, it also causes negative emotions due to stress. At both ends, the user often chooses to abandon the task.\n  \n  \n 2. The paradox of choice\n \nThere is a theory that believes when providing more options to people, there will be something for everyone, resulting in more conversions.

<div>Overcoming human irrationality with UX<br /><br />&ldquo;Forget about your competitors, just focus on your customers.&rdquo; This seems like a simple-yet-bold statement by Alibaba co-founder, Jack Ma. But do we as organisations really know our customers? Or do we just think that we do?<br /><br />We often believe that our customers are rational thinkers that make decisions based on what is best for them. However, it has often been proven that humans are irrational beings, often making decisions that are not based on facts or data, but rather on what makes them feel good. This is because humans are inherently emotional beings.<br /><br />&ldquo;Our thinking is riddled with systematic mistakes known to psychologists as cognitive biases. And they affect everything we do. They make us spend impulsively, be overly influenced by what other people think. They affect our beliefs, our opinions and our decisions, and we have no idea it is happening.&rdquo; &ndash; Toby Macdonald<br /><br />Taking users&rsquo; emotions and attitudes into account, user experience (UX) engineering is the process used to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.<br />If we look at this from a psychological aspect, it means addressing the clear drivers and blockers that contribute to why a user behaves towards a particular stimulus.<br /><br />Below are 2 short case studies on how companies relied on UX principles to understand human irrationality:<br /><br />1. The optimal level of challenge <br /><br />During the 1950s, General Mills food company released a branded, do-it-yourself cake mix. Each box contained all the ingredients required to bake the cake; packaged as a packet of dry ingredients, which included milk and eggs. All that was needed to bake the cake was to line a cake tin, add water to the mix and place the batter into the oven.<br /><br />When the product didn&rsquo;t sell General Mills decided to bring in a team of psychologists to determine why this was the case. They discovered that the targeted users believed that it was just too easy. They couldn&rsquo;t impress anyone with their cooking skills, as it felt like they were cheating.<br /><br />The company then decided to complicate the product slightly by adding in a single step to the process; to &ldquo;add an egg'&rdquo;. They relaunched the product and sales went through the roof, turning the negative user emotion of &rsquo;cheating&rsquo; into the positive emotion of &rsquo;participation&rsquo; in the process.<br /><br />Part of this can be attributed to the optimal level of challenge. The framework states that if something is too easy, it causes negative emotions due to boredom. It also states that if something is too challenging, it also causes negative emotions due to stress. At both ends, the user often chooses to abandon the task.<br /><br /><br />2. The paradox of choice<br /><br />There is a theory that believes when providing more options to people, there will be something for everyone, resulting in more conversions. However, a study about jams conducted in 2000 by psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper proved that more choice equals less conversions.<br /><br />The study took place at a local food market shopping centre with a table display with 24 different types jams on it. On a different day, the same table only had 6 different jams on it. While the table with the 24 jams was visited more often, the table with 6 variations saw a conversion rate that was 10 times higher.<br /><br />The leading theory is that the more data we&rsquo;re required to process before making a decision, the more strained the brain becomes. Less was more in this instance, but it isn&rsquo;t always the case, and a balance needs to be found with your consumers.<br /><br />In order for organisations to focus on their customers effectively, they need to know their customers&rsquo; mindsets and cognitive biases &ndash; something that is often easier said than done.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Serverless architecture is the inevitable future for most organisations, as major players in the technology sector are moving towards cloud platforms. This is due to cloud vendors&rsquo; abilities to provision and manage major computer resources, and drastically reduce the time-to-market. With the growing interest in serverless architecture, the market is expected to reach $7.7 billion by 2021.\n Sound too good to be true? Well, sort of. Most serverless architectures come with a risk called &lsquo;vendor lock-in&rsquo;. Vendor lock-in is where customers are dependent (i.e. locked-in) on a single cloud provider&rsquo;s technology implementation, and cannot easily move to a different vendor in future without substantial costs, legal constraints or technical incompatibilities.\n However, the real concern is how much you should allow these considerations to influence decisions about whether or not to commit to a particular serverless platform vendor. The reality is that there is always a degree of lock-in with any technology choice, and serverless is no different. Vendor lock-in is a reality, whether you are choosing a database, a programming language, or an operating system, and serverless is no different.\n Vendor lock-in is just another risk that comes with technology choices. But, like other risks, being tightly coupled to one cloud provider&rsquo;s services has its rewards. You get scalability, resilience and security in return, and can launch products to market earlier and iterate on them quicker. Because going serverless minimises the amount of undifferentiated heavy lifting that has to be done, you can better focus on creating business value.\n As with any technology move, however, it's a good idea to assess the potential risk and impact when choosing a vendor.\n The first step is to check which programming languages and software development kits (SDKs) are supported by the vendors you&rsquo;re considering. This will save you from incurring massive costs if and when you do decide to migrate to a different platform that shares the same language. If you realise during a migration that your new vendor does not support your chosen language, it will open a whole new set of problems to address before the migration can begin.\n The next big challenge after committing to the chosen language is to consider transferrable solution architectures. A good architectural pattern will make any future migrations of serverless functions much easier. If the base code remains the same during migration, the costs come down automatically.\n When choosing a cloud provider, the question isn&rsquo;t necessarily whether you should be worried about being locked in, but rather what considerations need to be in place before committing to a single vendor. Migrating from one vendor to another is not impossible, but costly and risky when done impulsively.\n Serverless platforms and services should be exploited for the right use cases. It can be cost-effective for burst and batch type workload scenarios, proof of concepts and low consistent-load systems. But for more traditional websites with predictable loads, there are more economical solutions to utilise.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The evolving role of IT budgets within large organisations\n While technology has been a focal point for businesses for some time now, technology budgeting and investment practices have been lagging. With the growing need for digital transformation within large organisations, IT budgets need to shift from a project-to-project execution model to one that is capacity-based and more flexible. IT and software are becoming the products themselves and will be permanently evolving. They cannot be seen as start/stop expenses. In many cases, they are the fuel for the organisations continued growth, or even relevance, and so need to be invested in proportionally.\n Traditionally, budgets have been defined and predetermined according to specific projects planned for the upcoming year, and the business sees IT as a cost centre based on these individual projects. However, as projects and technology requirements evolve from year to year, organisations should focus on building a capacitated IT competency instead, and use them as an engine room.\n Technology projects are never truly done, and there are constantly new demands from customers, 3rd party partnerships and internal users. As the market and business grow, new products and features are required on a constant basis. This happens weekly or even daily &ndash; not yearly. Expanding and improving software is now part and parcel of expanding and improving business.\n The diagram below highlights the differences between agile and traditional budgeting. In evolutionary budgeting approaches, the business and IT collectively decide on a budget that is proportional to role technology plays within the organisation &ndash; currently and into the future. A sensible IT budget should indicate the emphasis the organisation places on it as an investment (and sometimes an expense) relative to other capex areas. This step is specifically distinct from the concept of what that budget will be spent on. This is a &lsquo;working forwards&rsquo; approach.\n Agile budgeting allows for flexibility within teams to prioritise components instead of projects in its entirety. Because there is a readily available IT competency within the business, projects can be broken down further into a smaller granularity. These smaller components can then be executed on a purely priority-first basis, extracting maximum value from the budget. This also allows build and run investments to be mixed, making much more effective use of skills, capacity and talent. When there are budget or capacity cuts, IT can simply cut certain lower-priority components and focus on the next task at hand.\n With traditional budgeting, IT estimates costs for a list of predetermined projects for the year, and then asks the business for budget to deliver these set projects. This is a &lsquo;working backwards&rsquo; approach, which might should more diligent but also risks being too brittle. Should budgets be changed during the year, entire projects must be cut because there is little or no granularity in each project. They are each &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; in nature.\n  \n Traditional budgeting is still useful in instances where there are detailed, unchanging needs and a strict environment, whereas evolutionary budgeting relies on trust and talent from the agile teams.\n Modern and flexible delivery styles are not compatible with fixed budgets. Technology is an investment regardless of how it was budgeted for &ndash; the question is the efficiency and reach of that investment. There are gaps in our budgets, and there is time and money wasted on planning which is doomed to become redundant long before the cycle ends. This is important because it means there are opportunities to ultimately fit more work into the same total budget by working smartly.\n There is real value in the ability of the organisation to reprioritise, in this year and this budget. Better practical outcomes, less time spent re-planning and more time doing what matters on a shorter cycle. This can happen when IT and Business jointly determine a sensible budget which speaks directly to strategy, and then establish how to go about maximising that investment.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Most large enterprise executives have been feeling the pressure to upgrade legacy systems due to risks, costs, missing functionality, technical debt, and the growing necessity for digital offerings in every industry. In a complex landscape with bulky IT architectures that have been assembled over decades, how do you know what to modernise and which route to take? Legacy systems are often complex, affect multiple business units, rely on niche skills, and it&rsquo;s difficult to know where to start.\n  \n We have previously asked the question: Is upgrading your legacy systems a digital advantage or a giant waste of money? To answer this, technology executives will need to look at their entire IT landscape and establish a holistic and coherent strategy which starts with a mapping out of their as-is landscape. This can become the basis for a forward plan to address each platform, system or product on a priority basis in the direction of modernisation.\n  \n A practical modernisation strategy should include a wide range of initiatives tailored to each component in your map. Looking across the full picture, certain systems may not need to be modernised at all. These are stable enough to continue without any adjustments, or are planned for decommissioning. On the other hand, there will be a set of systems that are clear candidates to be replaced entirely, under the banner of innovation, risk or cost. The balance of platforms will then land in the &ldquo;uncertain&rdquo; category. It may not be immediately clear whether there is enough of a risk (or benefit) to modernise these systems. In these instances, further work is required to assess the best way forward.\n  \n Your modernisation strategy can then be meaningfully composed of a practical and cost-effective mix of 5 approaches applied to each platform or system in your map, depending on where each one falls.\n  \n 1. Assess\nAssessments are used when you&rsquo;re not entirely sure whether to modernise that specific system. This step is intended to undertake a full review of the purpose, functionality and audience for this technology, and create a business case for modernisation (or against it!) If there are good reasons to proceed, the case should also recommend which strategy to deploy: re-host, rewrite, renew, retire, replace, or convert these systems.\n  \n 2. Analyse\nDuring the analysis approach, business requirements are extracted from packaged or legacy software applications to gain a deeper understanding of underlying business methods. Systems are reverse engineered in readiness to make it redundant, either with a new system, or by dissolving its responsibility across many other systems.\n  \n 3. Enhance\nLegacy systems are often complex and interconnected, with lots of built up technical debt. Application remediation allows you to enhance and improve current systems&rsquo; functionality without having to replace them entirely. This avoids wasting money and time on replacing the whole system, by rather just removing a bottleneck and promoting simpler integration.\n  \n 4. Re-platform\nIn certain instances, a legacy application component will only need to be migrated to a newer, more efficient technology platform that has been nominated by the organisation. This is an administrative step that can reduce operational costs or licensing exposure, but also ensures consistency in the landscape by keeping things together, organised and secure.\n  \n 5. Replace\nDuring this approach, an application component is decommissioned entirely and replaced with a new system that takes current business needs into account. Usually this is necessary for critical line-of-business systems, competitive differentiators, or to enable new product lines which are dependent on these systems.\n  \n  \n  \n The need for technology-based or supported services in every organisation means that the pressure to modernise our ecosystems will not relent. It's not only about competitive ability though. There are cost-saving opportunities where newer platforms can displace older license-intensive tools, and many modern technologies that drive the customer experience or scalability we need to differentiate. These newer technologies rely on platforms, data and functionality that a legacy technology layer can&rsquo;t accommodate.\n  \n So where do you start? Start with a balanced strategy. A strategy that maps out the differing modernisation needs for each system in your landscape. This becomes a list of modernisation projects which can be prioritised in a tactical and strategic way. Usually this list looks at critical risk, customer needs, business outcome and profit and outlines a holistic strategy of technology-enablement for your business.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=61128" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:543,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=61128&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:572}">

Usually this is necessary for critical line-of-business systems, competitive differentiators, or to enable new product lines which are dependent on these systems.<br /><br /><br /><br />The need for technology-based or supported services in every organisation means that the pressure to modernise our ecosystems will not relent. It's not only about competitive ability though. There are cost-saving opportunities where newer platforms can displace older license-intensive tools, and many modern technologies that drive the customer experience or scalability we need to differentiate. These newer technologies rely on platforms, data and functionality that a legacy technology layer can&rsquo;t accommodate.<br /><br />So where do you start? Start with a balanced strategy. A strategy that maps out the differing modernisation needs for each system in your landscape. This becomes a list of modernisation projects which can be prioritised in a tactical and strategic way. Usually this list looks at critical risk, customer needs, business outcome and profit and outlines a holistic strategy of technology-enablement for your business.</div>

Costs associated with a customer include the cost of the actual product or service being sold, the commissions paid to the sales people, the organisation&rsquo;s fixed costs that need to be distributed across all customers and then there are additional variable costs.\n\nOnly once we have done Activity Based Costing and incorporated all fixed and variable costs, can we truly get an accurate reflection of a customer&rsquo;s profitability. In addition to trying to find out a customer&rsquo;s true profitability, analysing information to understand inefficiencies in a business is a big motivator.

These are all questions that good a BI solution should be able to provide answers to.\n\nTo successfully implement a BI solution, management needs to understand the disparate systems in their organisation.

No one in an organisation should have &lsquo;consolidating data not available in the BI solution&rsquo; as part of his or her job description.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Gathering the data\n Crowdsourcing, a term coined in 2005, describes a process used to obtain services, ideas and content by soliciting contributions from a population of people, knowingly or unknowingly, on the part of the participant. The emergence of the Internet has made crowdsourcing a common approach to obtain these services, ideas and content, regardless what the crowdsourcer may use them for. \n\nThere is a vast amount of information that is gathered using crowdsourcing projects, for example: \n  Wikipedia is the most popular referenced site on the Internet today, with close to 5 million content pages being maintained by users at an average of 21.78 edits per day and an excess of 732 million page edits since its inception.\n TripAdvisor, the Internet&rsquo;s largest travel site, allows potential travellers to plan their journeys by offering trusted advice from people who have been to the place in question. TripAdvisor hosts more than 170 million reviews and opinions on more than 4 million businesses in more than 140,000 destinations.\n Microsoft&rsquo;s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) programme enables MVPs to answer millions of questions each year. The MVPS provide vital feedback reflecting the needs of Microsoft customers. MVPs are not paid, instead, they answer questions to share their knowledge with others and for the recognition they receive.\n Waze, which was recently acquired by Google, allows its 50 million users to share information about daily traffic incidents and situations on roads. This information assists other users in travelling around efficiently.\n  \nIt is clear that we are living in an age of Big Data. Crowdsourcing is a very efficient way of gathering information that can be utilised for economic benefit or to benefit communities as a whole and to make our lives easier. The original nature of crowdsourcing is to use willing participants. Those who are can spend time and resources assisting in gathering and submitting information &ndash; whatever the crowdsourcer needs. With what some might describe as a revolution of the IoT, all of this has already changed. \n\n Possibilities\n \nImagine a world where everybody with Internet connectivity has the ability to, with a whole army of their own devices, submit information with minimal effort as frequently as they like or even in real-time and on demand &ndash; this is crowdsourcing on a whole new scale! In other words, we could start modelling the world and build an online state model of the world in which we live. This would be possible by making use of and connecting consumer&rsquo;s everyday devices, leading to a massive explosion of data. \n\nThe data can include almost any type of information, such as weather conditions, ocean currents and wildlife locations. Health information and the tracking of individuals&rsquo; medical history can make medical practitioners aware of their patients&rsquo; condition and may even assist in warning of conditions before the patient becomes aware of his or her symptoms. The data can also help researchers gain insight into any population or any items&rsquo; attributes. This could help us make assumptions and draw correlations between patterns we never even knew existed. Imagine being able to query a model of the world at your convenience. This means you can access information someone or someTHING logged, for example, on the route you might take on holiday or to work. You could access the data for whatever reason you need the specific information&hellip; if you can measure it, you can include it. \n\n Remote controlling &lsquo;Things&rsquo; based on information\n \nWhen you can request information from devices in real-time, you can also send commands. This means that we can start controlling devices remotely. We can set up rules in the cloud to perform specific tasks based on our observations of our &lsquo;world model&rsquo;, which is representing the state of the world. \n\n Speaking to everything\n \nInteraction between devices will mean that they will be able to &lsquo;speak&rsquo; to one another, and that devices will have the ability to act and to be controlled based on the state of everything around them &ndash; for example, this could mean: \n  We could control traffic lights based on specific traffic conditions.\n We could monitor the health of workers and stop access to hazardous work environments should there be any condition present that endangers a workforce.\n We could monitor the environments for less-than-ideal conditions.\n Autonomous cars can use information they obtain from other cars and conditions around them to drive safely without any human intervention &ndash; something major players such as Google are already developing.\n  \nSome of these things are already happening but they occur in isolation where integrating all of the data, or at least a platform to allow systems to do their own integration and correlation, can mean decision making and automation processes are much smarter. A whole plethora of possibilities opens up &ndash; for example, think about: \n  Convenience (home automation, stock-monitoring systems)\n Safety (warning systems monitoring various factors)\n Security (online motion sensors, cameras and tracking of items)\n Controlling devices based on &lsquo;awareness&rsquo; of present company\n Energy and resource usage optimisation (energy monitoring on electronics, effective irrigation control based on conditions)\n Health monitoring\n Occupational hygiene monitoring\n Wildlife preservation (tracking of animals and their vital statistics)\n  \n Futuristic but already affordable\n \nThere are probably many more &lsquo;futuristic&rsquo; uses but the fact is, the technology is already here and it is becoming more and more affordable and less power hungry. It is becoming cheaper and easier to implement. One way is to use the technology that already exists. Waze is already doing this without most of us even realising. Our smartphones and their sensory inputs are being used as &lsquo;Things&rsquo; on the Internet. When using Waze, without submitting traffic information manually, you are doing so by just using the application. It will log information with regards to your travel using the sensory inputs on your phone. Smartphones are, in many ways, some of the earliest &lsquo;Things&rsquo; on the Internet. \n\nCompanies, including Google, are spending money on mesh networks and are acquiring companies, such as Nest Labs amongst others, to assist with their research and development in this area. Many ways are being researched by big companies and hobbyists to make wireless communications cheaper and less power hungry. Hobbyists can already, with reasonable ease in their own homes, use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE and low frequency RF communications to gather sensory data. Using development platforms such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Beaglebone, these different communication media are being used by hobbyists to relay information and receive commands via the Internet. Fitness-tracking devices are becoming increasingly popular for active people. The traditional fitness computer/fitness watch manufactures have their hands full keeping up with new functionality being made available by a range of new entrants at affordable prices into their market. These are all connected to the Internet in some way, some real-time, others delayed, but they are all examples of &lsquo;Things&rsquo; already on the Internet. \n\n Barriers to entry\n \nIt is obvious that the obstacles to implementing these futuristic ideas are not technological. Each hobbyist can already create a model of his or her world. There are even products out there that give you access to devices in your home via the Internet. However, this is not where the power of the IoT lies. Individuals using these products would probably be able to control everything in their houses remotely, they can probably sense conditions remotely and can as a result, with some server side processing, set up some rules to automate and manage their world. This is very impressive, but probably also regarded as very &lsquo;geeky&rsquo; by most. The true power lies in taking everybody&rsquo;s small worlds and integrating them into one integrated world on the Internet. \n\n Protocols\n \nThe integration medium is already there in the form of the Internet but currently, the problem lies in the protocols used to get the information onto the Internet. Some would argue to use the same protocols as the rest of the Internet but there are difficulties with this. Our &lsquo;Things&rsquo; need to be low powered and cheap, therefore we would need lightweight protocols to move information efficiently to a single point on our local network, before passing it onto our traditional Internet. \n\nAt the moment, many protocols exist but we are in the process of seeing which one will emerge as the most used. This is important because consumers would want to, without thinking about it, have their devices or things able to use the same point of access to the Internet and able to talk to each other, or at the least to use each other, as a mesh networking node.\n\n Socioeconomics\n \nOther important questions include: are people ready for this? Will they embrace this change? The chances are that many will feel that this impacts their privacy, and would not want to share information. They believe that &lsquo;if it&rsquo;s no longer on my premises, I do not have control over who sees it&rsquo;. This notion, however, seems to be taking a backseat with organisations moving to utilise the benefits of cloud computing. The difference here, is that the IoT, does not only involve organisations but it also includes end consumers. Therefore a similar mind shift &ndash; cloud-based computing required from organisations &ndash; is required from consumers of these products and devices. \n\n Security\n \nConsumers are scared because they do not comprehend the likelihood, or the impact of risks regarding security. As a result, they also do not understand how to minimise the likelihood of these risks. With privacy being such a major concern, security is important to put device owners in compete control of who can see their data. With no single protocol at the moment being the norm, it is very difficult to have a single way to implement security in such a way, at device level (especially wireless devices) that is trusted to the same degree as the security on the Internet. Also, the impact of security breaches, especially on the remote-control side of devices, may also have a greater impact &ndash; imagine cars and access control being hacked. \n\n An extension of our Internet\n \nAdoption of the IoT will probably change our world in such a way that we cannot imagine right now. In essence, it is an extension of our Internet, as we have always known it. However, the IoT can control and read values of real- life things and it can be used to access more information than just what was posted by humans. Suddenly a whole new range of data sources can be made available on the Internet over HTTP and other protocols, and this data will be accessible similarly to how we make information in databases available.\n\nIn the same way the software world moved at an incredible pace, the hardware and embedded world started moving at the same pace with open source prototyping platforms, 3D printers and laser cutters. People are making their projects available open source. Everybody is collaborating and working on new devices, their communications and this &lsquo;new extension&rsquo; of our Internet. \n\nUsers should be prepared for a range of new solutions needed in the cloud to support all of the data gathered and innovations resulting from new opportunities made possible by the IoT. Exciting times are ahead and in the same way we converged on a set of standards on the Web, we will converge on a set of standards for the IoT that will integrate with our existing Web standards. \n\nCisco estimates that by 2020 we will have more than 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. Some might argue that 50 billion is optimistic but it does give you an idea of the level of belief Cisco has in the IoT growing. Cisco is not alone and companies including Google, IBM, Microsoft, have all made announcements regarding some sort of IoT innovation, and/or shown intention on capitalising on the growth of the IoT. Effectively, the IoT will move us from having smartphones, smartTVs, connected cars, and wearables to having smartcars, smarthomes, smartcities, smartoffices, smartfactories, and other smartenvironments.&quot;}">

<div>Gathering the data<br />Crowdsourcing, a term coined in 2005, describes a process used to obtain services, ideas and content by soliciting contributions from a population of people, knowingly or unknowingly, on the part of the participant. The emergence of the Internet has made crowdsourcing a common approach to obtain these services, ideas and content, regardless what the crowdsourcer may use them for. <br /><br />There is a vast amount of information that is gathered using crowdsourcing projects, for example: <br />Wikipedia is the most popular referenced site on the Internet today, with close to 5 million content pages being maintained by users at an average of 21.78 edits per day and an excess of 732 million page edits since its inception.<br />TripAdvisor, the Internet&rsquo;s largest travel site, allows potential travellers to plan their journeys by offering trusted advice from people who have been to the place in question. TripAdvisor hosts more than 170 million reviews and opinions on more than 4 million businesses in more than 140,000 destinations.<br />Microsoft&rsquo;s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) programme enables MVPs to answer millions of questions each year. The MVPS provide vital feedback reflecting the needs of Microsoft customers. MVPs are not paid, instead, they answer questions to share their knowledge with others and for the recognition they receive.<br />Waze, which was recently acquired by Google, allows its 50 million users to share information about daily traffic incidents and situations on roads. This information assists other users in travelling around efficiently.<br /><br />It is clear that we are living in an age of Big Data.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Big Data and the Vs&quot;}">Big Data and the Vs</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;After having many discussions about the topic of Big Data with Entelect&rsquo;s CTO, Martin Naude, I decided to visit my go-to website, Wikipedia, for a &lsquo;tidy&rsquo;, encyclopedic definition. According to Wiki, the concept of Big Data has been around since 2001. Initially, there were three V's that defined Big Data. These were volume, velocity and variety. However, this is where the main dilemma begins&hellip; no one can define any of these V's for me. There is no concise definition of what each one means or entails. So after all the research and more discussions, I have decided to throw the dictionary (and Wiki) out of the window on this one and come up with simpler, more realistic definitions of all the V's and at the same time, hopefully make sense of Big Data.\n\nWhile researching the &lsquo;volume&rsquo; side of Big Data, I found quite a few definitions. Some say the data must be terabytes, petabytes and even larger. However, &lsquo;volume&rsquo; was set as a pillar back in 2001, and when I look back on my career, in the early 2000s if someone had 100 gigabytes of data in a data store, he or she was on the bleeding edge and would probably asked to be a keynote speaker at a conference to explain how he or she actually got it right. Today, we are in a more privileged environment. For just US$3500 we can buy a small footprint hard drive that can store all the music that the world has ever produced. With the uptake of solid state drives, we are able to equip a server that has the ability to store and access tons of data without breaking the bank. So my definition of volume is more around the ability to store and access large volumes of data, and not purely a focus on the amount of data that constitutes Big Data.\n\n&lsquo;Velocity&rsquo; refers to rapidly changing data that is processed at a very quick rate. It won&rsquo;t come as a shock to find that I have an issue with this one, too! Where is the line in the sand to say we are processing quickly: is it 6 gigabytes a second as in the case of the Large Hadron Collider, is it 1,000 transactions a second or is it once a month? I believe that velocity is less of an important consideration and rather that it is the ability to process, analyse and output the transactions at a required rate over a specific required timeframe. For example, transactional fraud detection is important and we may need near-real-time algorithms to run against the transactions processing, otherwise, our risk exposure would increase dramatically. For geofencing applications we need near-real time, too. However, if we want to analyse a debtors&rsquo; book, an acceptable time of a day or two to run certain scenarios and put plans in place for results processing is fine.\n\nWhen we look at velocity, we also need to take into account several external factors. These include infrastructure and Internet speeds, storage ability and processing speeds. This is where software meets hardware and fortunately, we are in the middle of a software boom: new data storage engines are being released every month and we now have the likes of Mongo, NewSQL, NoSQL, Hadoop and many more that challenge our preconceptions of storing data in non-traditional formats.\n\n&lsquo;Variety&rsquo; is the one &lsquo;V&rsquo; that has really matured over the last ten years. We now have the Internet of Things (IoT) and in sensor-driven manufacturing, we have the ability to pull in social media information to take our understanding of our customer to the next level, and we also have many more lines of business systems that we did ten years ago. This is where the real challenge starts from a Business Intelligence (BI), analytics and Big Data point of view. We can no longer pick a technology and run with it. Historically, organisations were a Microsoft or an Oracle outfit but they are now faced with the challenge of running side-by-side appliances that are appropriate for the relevant variety of data they are attempting to consolidate and relate. Today, organisations need to start diversifying from a single-vendor solution (although I don&rsquo;t think believe traditional relational database will ever die), to face a new challenge of taking that traditional relational data and relating it to unstructured data (for example, on a Hadoop appliance) and yet still provide the results through a mechanism that business users can understand while remaining intuitive.\n\nI am not sure what happened in 2012 but another V was added to the list &ndash; &lsquo;Veracity&rsquo;. This means that the data needs to conform to the truth and the data has to be trusted. This, to me, brings everything back together and forms the foundation for a Big Data implementation. In everything we are doing, we need to ensure that what we are providing to business conforms to the truth and can be trusted. If we look up some successful Big Data applications and implementations, we just need to ask the question &lsquo;what if the data was wrong?&rsquo; and we will quickly understand the importance of this. When President Obama ran his micro-targeting campaigns, there was very little room for error and the data had to be correct. This is also the case with Amazon.com, which is trialling delivering goods before customers order them. To do this effectively, the company has written such great algorithms to predict what customers are going to order (and when they will order), that if the data is only 90 per cent accurate, the company, stands to lose a lot of money. Then we have Uber, a company that is setting a benchmark for others, innovating in several industries as not just another taxi service. Uber published the algorithm for predicting a client&rsquo;s destination, and can now begin to offer car-pool services. The value of accurate and correct data is easily understood.\n\nWith all these V&rsquo;s in place, there seem to be many more marketable V's that can easily be strapped onto the existing foundation. &lsquo;Visualisation&rsquo; is important: can we provide business with the information in a format that makes sense? Businesses are spoilt with the number of technologies available to use for a presentation layer. However, this also brings another conundrum &ndash; which visualisation tool do they use? And this is where we start balancing cutting edge with bleeding edge. At least once a month, I speak to a potential client who mentions a new visualisation tool and asks if we at Entelect have expertise in it. Each tool has its own pros and cons, and here is where we need to take a step back and define what functionality we are actually looking for in a visualization tool.\n\nI have done countless implementations where self-service BI was a hard requirement, so the tools were selected and the universe of data provided. Then, however, when I checked in a few months later, the company had employed report writers because they didn&rsquo;t actually want to write their own reports or their IT department was experiencing headaches because everyone was applying different filters to the data and expecting the same result. Do we actually need interactive charts and graphs, with drill down and drill through, bottom-up and top-down reporting? For many, these requirements are a must, until you mention the price of the potential tool, then they quickly move to a show value first and add the sexy visualisations later. I have never seen a successful revenue assurance implementation run on anything other than raw data. What I am trying to emphasise is that companies need to keep their short-term goals in mind, and before they fork out a lot of money on a visualisation tool, make sure that the path they are going down is going to add value to the business.\n\n&lsquo;Value&rsquo; has also been added to the list of V's. Now that we have all the data and it is available to look at, how do we actually extract value from this? New roles are being created within organisations, for example, we now have chief data officers and the role of the data scientist is also gaining business traction. Once again, before businesses go out and spend money on someone with a quants or risk qualification, they need to look internally for the person I like call the &lsquo;Miss Congeniality&rsquo; of your company. This is someone who has been at the company for many years and worked across the majority of the departments. This is the person who best understands the lower levels of the business. He or she is one who understands how the insurance department influences the credit department and the implications thereof. This person will create the foundation before the data scientists arrive.\n\nIn the field of data analytics, many companies have invested in out-of-the-box analytics that will provide a perceived &lsquo;easy way&rsquo; to analyse data. It is quick to push out a time series forecast or a decision tree and to cluster the base. This is great, but keep in mind that there is no competitive advantage. Out-of-the-box tools are available to anyone who is willing to pay for them. Know up front that if you want something different, it is going to have to be bespoke.\n\nSo now we have all the theory and the best-case scenario examples. The number of success stories I have read are countless. However, the number I have seen properly implemented are far fewer. We all know the benefits of using this data to drive sales, increase revenue during down times and to engage customers more effectively.\n\nIn South Africa we have access to exactly the same technology as the rest of the world, we have people in this country who are able to create the custom algorithms and to stand up as the true data scientists. The question remains, &lsquo;why are we still behind the curve on this, why are we not the benchmark?&rsquo; My pledge to the data community of South Africa is to invest in Big Data competency over the next 12 months and keep you updated each step of the way, I hope to further learn what actually works and what doesn&rsquo;t, in practical and real-world environments. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, we will be able to position South Africa as the world leaders in Big Data.&quot;}">

For geofencing applications we need near-real time, too. However, if we want to analyse a debtors&rsquo; book, an acceptable time of a day or two to run certain scenarios and put plans in place for results processing is fine.<br /><br />When we look at velocity, we also need to take into account several external factors. These include infrastructure and Internet speeds, storage ability and processing speeds. This is where software meets hardware and fortunately, we are in the middle of a software boom: new data storage engines are being released every month and we now have the likes of Mongo, NewSQL, NoSQL, Hadoop and many more that challenge our preconceptions of storing data in non-traditional formats.<br /><br />&lsquo;Variety&rsquo; is the one &lsquo;V&rsquo; that has really matured over the last ten years. We now have the Internet of Things (IoT) and in sensor-driven manufacturing, we have the ability to pull in social media information to take our understanding of our customer to the next level, and we also have many more lines of business systems that we did ten years ago. This is where the real challenge starts from a Business Intelligence (BI), analytics and Big Data point of view. We can no longer pick a technology and run with it. Historically, organisations were a Microsoft or an Oracle outfit but they are now faced with the challenge of running side-by-side appliances that are appropriate for the relevant variety of data they are attempting to consolidate and relate. Today, organisations need to start diversifying from a single-vendor solution (although I don&rsquo;t think believe traditional relational database will ever die), to face a new challenge of taking that traditional relational data and relating it to unstructured data (for example, on a Hadoop appliance) and yet still provide the results through a mechanism that business users can understand while remaining intuitive.<br /><br />I am not sure what happened in 2012 but another V was added to the list &ndash; &lsquo;Veracity&rsquo;. This means that the data needs to conform to the truth and the data has to be trusted. This, to me, brings everything back together and forms the foundation for a Big Data implementation. In everything we are doing, we need to ensure that what we are providing to business conforms to the truth and can be trusted. If we look up some successful Big Data applications and implementations, we just need to ask the question &lsquo;what if the data was wrong?&rsquo; and we will quickly understand the importance of this. When President Obama ran his micro-targeting campaigns, there was very little room for error and the data had to be correct. This is also the case with Amazon.com, which is trialling delivering goods before customers order them. To do this effectively, the company has written such great algorithms to predict what customers are going to order (and when they will order), that if the data is only 90 per cent accurate, the company, stands to lose a lot of money. Then we have Uber, a company that is setting a benchmark for others, innovating in several industries as not just another taxi service. Uber published the algorithm for predicting a client&rsquo;s destination, and can now begin to offer car-pool services. The value of accurate and correct data is easily understood.<br /><br />With all these V&rsquo;s in place, there seem to be many more marketable V's that can easily be strapped onto the existing foundation. &lsquo;Visualisation&rsquo; is important: can we provide business with the information in a format that makes sense? Businesses are spoilt with the number of technologies available to use for a presentation layer. However, this also brings another conundrum &ndash; which visualisation tool do they use? And this is where we start balancing cutting edge with bleeding edge. At least once a month, I speak to a potential client who mentions a new visualisation tool and asks if we at Entelect have expertise in it. Each tool has its own pros and cons, and here is where we need to take a step back and define what functionality we are actually looking for in a visualization tool.<br /><br />I have done countless implementations where self-service BI was a hard requirement, so the tools were selected and the universe of data provided. Then, however, when I checked in a few months later, the company had employed report writers because they didn&rsquo;t actually want to write their own reports or their IT department was experiencing headaches because everyone was applying different filters to the data and expecting the same result. Do we actually need interactive charts and graphs, with drill down and drill through, bottom-up and top-down reporting? For many, these requirements are a must, until you mention the price of the potential tool, then they quickly move to a show value first and add the sexy visualisations later. I have never seen a successful revenue assurance implementation run on anything other than raw data. What I am trying to emphasise is that companies need to keep their short-term goals in mind, and before they fork out a lot of money on a visualisation tool, make sure that the path they are going down is going to add value to the business.<br /><br />&lsquo;Value&rsquo; has also been added to the list of V's. Now that we have all the data and it is available to look at, how do we actually extract value from this? New roles are being created within organisations, for example, we now have chief data officers and the role of the data scientist is also gaining business traction. Once again, before businesses go out and spend money on someone with a quants or risk qualification, they need to look internally for the person I like call the &lsquo;Miss Congeniality&rsquo; of your company. This is someone who has been at the company for many years and worked across the majority of the departments. This is the person who best understands the lower levels of the business. He or she is one who understands how the insurance department influences the credit department and the implications thereof. This person will create the foundation before the data scientists arrive.<br /><br />In the field of data analytics, many companies have invested in out-of-the-box analytics that will provide a perceived &lsquo;easy way&rsquo; to analyse data. It is quick to push out a time series forecast or a decision tree and to cluster the base. This is great, but keep in mind that there is no competitive advantage. Out-of-the-box tools are available to anyone who is willing to pay for them. Know up front that if you want something different, it is going to have to be bespoke.<br /><br />So now we have all the theory and the best-case scenario examples. The number of success stories I have read are countless. However, the number I have seen properly implemented are far fewer. We all know the benefits of using this data to drive sales, increase revenue during down times and to engage customers more effectively.<br /><br />In South Africa we have access to exactly the same technology as the rest of the world, we have people in this country who are able to create the custom algorithms and to stand up as the true data scientists. The question remains, &lsquo;why are we still behind the curve on this, why are we not the benchmark?&rsquo; My pledge to the data community of South Africa is to invest in Big Data competency over the next 12 months and keep you updated each step of the way, I hope to further learn what actually works and what doesn&rsquo;t, in practical and real-world environments. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, we will be able to position South Africa as the world leaders in Big Data.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The reason for the belief in the data age is that as each millionth of a second passes, almost everything we see, hear and touch is generating data. Using PCs, mobile handsets, tablets, GPS devices, servers and sensors attached to vehicles, buildings and satellites, leads to huge amounts of data being stored across multiple databases and data stores worldwide. The speed at which this data is being generated is increasing rapidly and so is the volume and array of different structured and unstructured data types, which are commonly referred to as Big Data. \n\nIn theory, Big Data means having tons and tons of data at your disposal. However, in practice, this data is next to useless if businesses cannot apply analytics to benefit and gain insight from it. Businesses must find a &lsquo;mechanism&rsquo; that can perform collaborative filtering to &lsquo;net&rsquo; vital information and trends and to answer key questions. \n\nBut, how easy is it to find this mechanism? Currently, there are frameworks that have been developed to store and retrieve the data using MapReduce algorithms. Apache Hadoop is one of the frameworks of choice, and some of the large tech and social media companies have shown a keen interest in it. \n\nHadoop is so popular because of the speed at which it can load the volume and variety of data compared with other ETL (extract-transform-load) tools and frameworks. Hadoop can load data much quicker than relational databases because it has no gatekeeping rules. It stores the data on its HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) without needing to match the destination structure with the source structure &ndash; a relational database would require &lsquo;Table B&rsquo; to be the same as &lsquo;Table A&rsquo; in order to transfer data across. Instead, Hadoop stores the data across numerous data nodes using key-value pairs. Initially, querying data on HDFS was slow and involved a great deal of effort. To complete the task, a more SQL-like language was needed. However, over the years, many contributions have been made to this open-source software framework. Currently there are many &lsquo;SQL on Hadoop&rsquo; languages, such as Apache Hive, Stinger, Apaches Drill and Spark SQL, which have improved data-retrieval performance considerably. \n\nHadoop&rsquo;s architecture is very scalable so this allows for millions of servers to work together instead of running one high-specced server. Hadoop is also fault tolerant, storing multiple copies of each piece of data in different nodes. If one node goes down, the framework will automatically switch over to another in the most efficient manner. \n\nIn recent times, Hadoop has received a lot of buy-in from the big-player analytics and visualisations vendors. Cloudera is partnering with NoSQL creator MongoDB, and Hortonworks has collaborated with Tableau. Other vendors, such as Qlikview, Spotfire and Microstrategy, have some ODBC configuration to connect to Hadoop. Cloudera has released a universal ODBC driver that enables the connection of many applications, such as Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT), SSIS, IBM DataStage, Ab Initio, Informatica PowerCenter, SAP Data Services, Business Objects, OBIEE, Cognos, SAS, SPSS, Unica, Linked Server, Oracle Database Gateway and many more. \n\nThis all sounds very exciting and convincing that Hadoop is the way to go. However, although Big Data has been around for years, it has still not taken off in the South African market as initially predicted. If you or your company is equipped with skill set similar to these large tech and social media companies, then implementing a Big Data solution is not an issue. However, the question is how many companies are actually equipped with a skill set? The answer is not many and the market is showing a massive demand for Big Data resources. Global management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company has predicted that by the year 2018, the shortfall of Big Data experts will be at anywhere from 140,000 to 190,000. \n\nThe good news is that tertiary institutions are now including Big Data in their curricula and post-graduate degrees, so we can expect the Big Data resource pool to grow over time as these students complete their studies. Until this happens, companies are investing in their current staff compliment to fill the gap. However, learning Big Data via frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop, is quite a steep learning curve compared with traditional, structured BI involving SQL, ETL and OLAP tools, and to a certain degree, it requires a mindset shift. \n\nCompanies do have other options. They can opt for a cloud solution like Microsoft&rsquo;s HDInsight sitting on their Azure platform. This option has its pros and cons. On the plus side, it collects and stores your data at a reasonable price on your HDInsight cluster. There is no need to understand the background processing and architecture of Hadoop. Microsoft has also developed a way to combine and query both non-relational data (HDInsight) with structured SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse in the form of Polybase. This integrates perfectly with the latest version of Microsoft Excel and an assortment of PowerBI tools, such as PowerPivot and PowerQuery. One of the biggest negatives for this option is the cost involved in processing and retrieving the answers you looking for. There is also the security element of storing sensitive data on an off-site server, perhaps half-way across the globe. Implementing data governance can also be tricky with regard to unstructured data and defining which users are authorised to see which data. \n\nAnother option companies may choose is to engage with consulting companies that have already invested time, research and development in Hadoop and its architecture. Consultancy firms allow their staff autonomy to play around with cutting-edge technologies and often give them carte blanche to find innovative ways of solving tomorrow&rsquo;s business needs. This allows companies to use this expertise and knowledge without wasting unnecessary time and money. \n\nWhichever option you choose to invest in, I believe Big Data is the must-have component that should be found in every company&rsquo;s BI architectural framework. Due to the current skill shortage and reluctance to opt for a cloud solution, Big Data may not be a priority for companies at the moment, but it will definitely become a must in the future. The quicker businesses get their Big Data solution up and running, the faster they will be able to gain a substantial leading edge over their competitors. The race is on for companies to find the answers of tomorrow based on the data that was always there but could never before be analysed.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sometimes, a buzzword emerges out of necessity &ndash; there simply is no other way to describe a new phenomenon or trend. In many cases, however, it is a shift in thinking or a reincarnation of an old concept that provides the marketing fraternity with a fresh opportunity to create a &lsquo;buzz&rsquo;.\n\nInstead of fostering a real understanding, the use of buzzwords and jargon can create misconceptions that ultimately slow down the decision-making process. At best, people waste time trying to understand what is essentially something very simple. At worst, they miss an opportunity. Either way, new terms can be confusing, so I have decoded some of the IT industry&rsquo;s up-and-coming jargon and buzzwords.\n\n1. Big Data: Big Data refers to the large amounts of data that are typically collected from events triggered by particular actions or devices monitoring some phenomena, often stored in a loosely structured format. Traditional techniques for processing these large data sets are ineffective and new approaches are necessary to collect, retrieve, summarise and visualise &ndash; turning the data into something more meaningful.\n\nThe generally accepted defining properties of Big Data are known as the Three Vs, which Gartner analyst Doug Laney originally coined:?  Volume &ndash; the amount of data stored\n Velocity &ndash; the rate at which data is generated and processed\n Variety &ndash; the type and source of the data.\n  \nIf each of these properties is increasing significantly, the information can be considered to be Big Data.\n\nAside from the fact that companies are collecting vast amounts of information on customers&rsquo; movements, behaviour and buying habits, why is Big Data important from a business perspective? The old adage of &lsquo;knowledge is power&rsquo; holds true. The more equipped people are to make decisions, the better the outcome for their business. What is relevant in the case of Big Data however, is making sense of the information (separating the noise from the meaningful), the timing of the information, and how to use the information effectively to improve a product or service. The current movement in Big Data aims to address these issues and is reshaping our understanding of how to process information on a much larger scale.\n\n2. Prescriptive Analytics: Making sense of the information leads us to the field of data analytics &ndash; the tools and techniques that are used to extract meaning from huge volumes of data. Analytics efforts can be broadly classified into one of three main categories &ndash; descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.\n\nDescriptive analytics tells us what has happened and possibly why it has happened. It usually involves reporting on historical data to provide insights into various business metrics. Predictive analytics attempts to tell us what may happen in the future, taking historical data into account and applying algorithms and various statistical models to predict the future.\n\nPrescriptive analytics, the third and most recent focus area of data analytics, takes it to the next level by recommending a course of action, and presenting the likely outcomes of choosing such action, incorporating any constraints of the current environment (financial or regulatory, for example). An actual person still has to make the decisions but prescriptive analytics can provide valuable input into scenario planning and optimisation exercises, by combining business rules, statistical models and machine learning to quantify the impact of future decisions.\n\nThere is a variety of organisations that have invested significant effort in descriptive analytics and reporting solutions to provide insight into historical data, and many are starting to explore the opportunities that predictive analytics has to offer. Both are necessary precursors to prescriptive analytics, which requires, at a minimum, the capability to capture and summarise large data sets efficiently. The data can then be used as input to prescriptive analytic engines.\n\n3. Software-defined infrastructure (SDI): Software-defined infrastructure builds on the capabilities of virtualisation and cloud-based services to define IT infrastructure requirements. These requirements include computing power, as well as network and storage capacity, at the software level. SDI allows application developers to describe their expectations of infrastructure in a standard and systematic way, turning computing resources into logical components that can be provisioned on the fly without human intervention.\n\nTake today&rsquo;s scenario of having to configure each element of infrastructure to support an application &ndash; machines and images, storage and mount points, firewalls and load balancers to name a few &ndash; and replace it with the simple action of identifying an SDI-enabled data centre and clicking &lsquo;deploy&rsquo;. Each resource is automatically configured as required and, more importantly, can reconfigure itself as the application and usage changes.\n\nDefining these requirements based on policies and expected usage patterns at the software level and incorporating them into the deployable artefacts, means that IT organisations can respond more quickly to peaks and troughs in throughput and achieve repeatable and reliable application deployments by automating many infrastructure related activities.\n\nFurthermore, SDI-enabled data centres can optimise resource usage, which will drive down the cost of infrastructure. Specialists can focus on optimising specific elements of the infrastructure, such as network or storage, rather than reactively wiring and rewiring configurations to support evolving application requirements.\n\nAs was the case with Java and the standardised APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that make up the Java Enterprise Edition framework, SDI will require a concerted effort to ensure inter-operability between the tools, platforms and processes that make up the virtual data centres of the future. As with cloud services, there is a vendor battle brewing to capture the lion&rsquo;s share of what is likely to be a significant market for SDI-capable services. Those vendors who actively drive and support open interfaces and APIs will have the advantage in the long term.\n\n4. DevOps: The term DevOps has been around for some time now and the concept, even longer. However, only in recent years has it started gaining widespread acceptance as standard practice in the development communities. DevOps is to development and operations teams as Agile is to development teams and business. Where the Agile movement promotes increased collaboration between development teams and business users, DevOps looks at integrating operations activities much earlier and more tightly into the software-development life cycle. Both have the same goal of enabling software projects to respond more effectively to change.\n\nIn reality, DevOps is an extension of Agile as we know it today. However, it also includes operations and support functions. The authors of the Agile Manifesto certainly never explicitly excluded operations and support from their widely accepted list of values and principles but in the experience of many, the focus on Agile projects has always been biased towards improving the collaboration between business users and the development team, rather than the development team and the operations team.\n\nYes, it is true that the operations team is implicitly included in the concept of cross-functional development teams (see below), but in reality, IT operations in many organisations are still very much an isolated function, which is exactly the barrier that DevOps is trying to eliminate.\n\n5. Cross-functional teams: The concept of a cross-functional team is simple. The development team has all the skills necessary to deliver a piece of working software into production, which may include activities such as user experience design, database design, server configuration and, of course, writing code. Where product development teams are concerned, businesses adopting Agile practices should be assembling cross-functional teams.\n\nThis is not an excuse for hiring fewer individuals and expecting them to be Jacks-of-all-trades: specialisation is important and a necessity when solving complex problems that require focus and experience. Having a single, co-located team that can take something from concept to reality, eliminates external dependencies that plague many software development teams of today, especially in large organisations.\n\nAside from efficiency and knowledge sharing, the argument for isolated teams defined by skill or technology is the degree of control of standards and governance within a particular domain. This argument is valid but only for operational and &lsquo;commoditised&rsquo; services, such as desktop support and hardware infrastructure. As soon as product development enters the mix, the effectiveness of the team becomes more important than the efficiency of the team. Assuming differentiation is one of the main objectives, product development teams should be optimised for effectiveness rather than efficiency, since development in this scenario is a creative process, one that should not be constrained by red tape and corporate IT governance.\n\nIf companies want to increase their chances of creating a product that delights their customers, they should include specialists and designers in the team as full-time members until their services are no longer deemed critical, which will probably be only after several production releases. If you want to minimise your IT costs at the expense of rapid innovation, create a dedicated team that out-sources its services to several internal development teams.\n\nWhile the occurrence of new &lsquo;buzzwords&rsquo; in the ICT space is on-going, it is crucial that decision makers ensure a practical and simplified understanding before making any kind of investment on behalf of their organisation. Often designed to excite and compel, these buzzwords often do not describe the actual function or benefits of a particular concept. At Entelect, we encourage business leaders to screen potential IT suppliers not by the terminology and complicated jargon they offer, but rather by how simply and understandably they are able to communicate their solutions.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:706,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=39759&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:714}{&quot;1&quot;:6181,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=32819&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:6187}">
<div>
<div>Sometimes, a buzzword emerges out of necessity &ndash; there simply is no other way to describe a new phenomenon or trend. In many cases, however, it is a shift in thinking or a reincarnation of an old concept that provides the marketing fraternity with a fresh opportunity to create a &lsquo;buzz&rsquo;.<br /><br />Instead of fostering a real understanding, the use of buzzwords and jargon can create misconceptions that ultimately slow down the decision-making process. At best, people waste time trying to understand what is essentially something very simple. At worst, they miss an opportunity. Either way, new terms can be confusing, so I have decoded some of the IT industry&rsquo;s up-and-coming jargon and buzzwords.<br /><br />1. Big Data: Big Data refers to the large amounts of data that are typically collected from events triggered by particular actions or devices monitoring some phenomena, often stored in a loosely structured format. Traditional techniques for processing these large data sets are ineffective and new approaches are necessary to collect, retrieve, summarise and visualise &ndash; turning the data into something more meaningful.<br /><br />The generally accepted defining properties of Big Data are known as the Three Vs, which Gartner analyst Doug Laney originally coined:? Volume &ndash; the amount of data stored<br />Velocity &ndash; the rate at which data is generated and processed<br />Variety &ndash; the type and source of the data.<br /><br />If each of these properties is increasing significantly, the information can be considered to be Big Data.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that companies are collecting vast amounts of information on customers&rsquo; movements, behaviour and buying habits, why is Big Data important from a business perspective? The old adage of &lsquo;knowledge is power&rsquo; holds true. The more equipped people are to make decisions, the better the outcome for their business. What is relevant in the case of Big Data however, is making sense of the information (separating the noise from the meaningful), the timing of the information, and how to use the information effectively to improve a product or service. The current movement in Big Data aims to address these issues and is reshaping our understanding of how to process information on a much larger scale.<br /><br />2. Prescriptive Analytics: Making sense of the information leads us to the field of data analytics &ndash; the tools and techniques that are used to extract meaning from huge volumes of data. Analytics efforts can be broadly classified into one of three main categories &ndash; descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.<br /><br />Descriptive analytics tells us what has happened and possibly why it has happened. It usually involves reporting on historical data to provide insights into various business metrics. Predictive analytics attempts to tell us what may happen in the future, taking historical data into account and applying algorithms and various statistical models to predict the future.<br /><br />Prescriptive analytics, the third and most recent focus area of data analytics, takes it to the next level by recommending a course of action, and presenting the likely outcomes of choosing such action, incorporating any constraints of the current environment (financial or regulatory, for example). An actual person still has to make the decisions but prescriptive analytics can provide valuable input into scenario planning and optimisation exercises, by combining business rules, statistical models and machine learning to quantify the impact of future decisions.<br /><br />There is a variety of organisations that have invested significant effort in descriptive analytics and reporting solutions to provide insight into historical data, and many are starting to explore the opportunities that predictive analytics has to offer. Both are necessary precursors to prescriptive analytics, which requires, at a minimum, the capability to capture and summarise large data sets efficiently. The data can then be used as input to prescriptive analytic engines.<br /><br />3. Software-defined infrastructure (SDI): Software-defined infrastructure builds on the capabilities of virtualisation and cloud-based services to define IT infrastructure requirements. These requirements include computing power, as well as network and storage capacity, at the software level. SDI allows application developers to describe their expectations of infrastructure in a standard and systematic way, turning computing resources into logical components that can be provisioned on the fly without human intervention.<br /><br />Take today&rsquo;s scenario of having to configure each element of infrastructure to support an application &ndash; machines and images, storage and mount points, firewalls and load balancers to name a few &ndash; and replace it with the simple action of identifying an SDI-enabled data centre and clicking &lsquo;deploy&rsquo;. Each resource is automatically configured as required and, more importantly, can reconfigure itself as the application and usage changes.<br /><br />Defining these requirements based on policies and expected usage patterns at the software level and incorporating them into the deployable artefacts, means that IT organisations can respond more quickly to peaks and troughs in throughput and achieve repeatable and reliable application deployments by automating many infrastructure related activities.<br /><br />Furthermore, SDI-enabled data centres can optimise resource usage, which will drive down the cost of infrastructure.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;While data lakes are becoming more popular, they should not be a tick-box exercise. Effective use of a data lake can provide insights that make significant improvements to your organizational strategy. But, this can only be achieved with the right resources. Business often talks about having &lsquo;the right people, in the right seats on the bus&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s also about making sure the ride stays interesting. \n  \n  \n At this year&rsquo;s Chief Data Officer Forum Africa, the subject of data lakes was a hot topic, as was retaining top talent. But, while businesses become aware of the advantages of data lakes, many do not understand how to leverage them for maximum results. So although, these may seem like separate topics, they are in fact interconnected.\n  \n In the big data environment, many companies are starting to pull away from the traditional approach of Extract Transform Load (ETL) towards Extract Load Transform (ELT). But the emergence of the Data Lake in this shift towards ELT shouldn&rsquo;t just be viewed as a tick box. In fact, it should be a strategic play to provide your organisation with comprehensive and unique insights to be more competitive.\n  \n Once a company appreciates the potential of a data lake, it is in a position to pull incredibly exciting insights. However, to leverage a data lake to its fullest requires a diversity of people and skill sets. In this sense, a culture of innovation that drives continuous learning and collaboration should be considered the &lsquo;best friend&rsquo; of exceptional data science.\n  \n This is why the topic of data lakes become inextricably linked with attracting and retaining top talent, since extracting insights will be dependent on the capability of the data science team.\n  \n Finding a data scientist is tough. In fact, the role is most effectively delivered through two roles, a data engineer and a data analyst. Where a data engineer can populate the data lake and perform the ELT operations, the data analyst can communicate the results to the business in such a way that strategic financial and operational decisions can be made. Consequently, these two roles require different stimulation to sustain high productivity, continuous innovation and ultimately, ensure retention.\n  \n Retention therefore, is about making sure the &lsquo;ride stays interesting&rsquo;. Data engineers and analysts are working in a highly evolving industry so the culture they operate in needs to support this. It requires a strong focus on innovating within roles and structures, which is why the best fit for this industry are environments that create a culture of innovation.\n  \n While big business is under constant pressure to sweat its assets, a consultancy firm has more flexibility to invest in retention strategies such as continual learning and a flexible working environment. Consultancies know that best practices are what differentiate them from their competitors, so these are investments they are willing to make. Similarly, big businesses can be assured of a data science team that is constantly stimulated and in-touch with best practice.\n  \n Some ways that outsourced consultancies create a culture of innovation:\n  \n 1. Consulting companies pride themselves in investing heavily in in-house training programmes that ensure clients are impressed with the skills provided. This serves the dual purpose of improving delivery and keeping the staff continually growing and learning. Staff should be incentivised to attend conferences, get involved in the development community.\n  \n 2. Regarding the work environment for data engineers and analysts, flexibility and freedom will encourage and incentivise the team to come up with new ideas. Providing them with spare time to implement these, whether it be playing around with facial recognition software or thinking of different ways to analyse tweet streams for certain topics, is key to creating a flexible environment.\n  \n 3. Outsourcing is also beneficial to leverage the strengths of the skills effectively. In build phase, a consulting firm can allocate someone who is strong at ELT&rsquo;s, mainly setting up and optimising the data into the data lake. Once it&rsquo;s in the data lake, you can bring on the analysts. This &lsquo;roll-on, roll-off&rsquo; approach ensures the client always has the best person for the job and means consultancies can be as agile as the client requires.\n  \n 4. Lastly, knowledge transference is critical, because support and maintenance tasks are not for everyone. Transferring the IP back to clients by including them in training sessions, and walking the journey together to build up the internal capacity, means consultancies and clients can both get the most out of the partnership.\n  \n  \n The world of Big Data is changing quickly. I believe that if you are looking to select a partner to accompany you on the journey of implementing a meaningful big data solution, you need to find a company with a culture of innovation that is always looking for new ways to do things, learning new technologies, and staying up-to-date with trends. While the inclusion of a data lake may provide great opportunities for business, a data science team that can adapt to industry culture and remain relevant will keep the ride interesting and provide you with the best results.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The main draw for SQL Server 2016, at least from my point of view, is the Query Store.\n  \n Query Store allows us to answer the question of how queries were performing in the past, to easily track and fix query performance regressions, to see total resource consumption over time and to identify expensive queries. Previously we would have needed to run Extended Event sessions over periods of time, import the results and aggregate them and then analyse the results, and that&rsquo;s prone to missing queries if they don&rsquo;t run all the time. DMVs don&rsquo;t have that problem, but the data they contain is not persisted, and is lost when the server restarts.\n  \n Query Store, once it is enabled, captures queries, plans and performance characteristics and persists them into the database. Since it&rsquo;s persisted and running all the time, we don&rsquo;t need to worry about whether there was an extended event session running when a query showed a problem, or whether the server has been restarted since the problem started. The data showing historical query performance is a query away.\n  \n And that&rsquo;s far from the only feature added in this version.\n  \n We received temporal tables, tables that automatically keep a history and which are queryable for how the data in the table looked at any point in time.\n  \n Stretch DB was introduced, the ability to stretch a table into Azure so that cold data can be stored in the cloud, transparently to users.\n  \n Always Encrypted finally provides an answer to preventing the DBA from seeing data by transparently encrypting the data in the application and storing only encrypted data in the database.\n  \n Row level security allows users to be assigned rights to read or modify subsets of the data in tables. No more need to add views for security.\n  \n Live query statistics makes diagnosing current query problems easier, as there&rsquo;s no need to wait for the query to finish to get the run-time statistics.\n  \n There are also improvements to Columnstore indexes, In-memory OLTP, Always On Availability Groups and a pile of internal optimisations that make SQL Server 2016 just run faster.\n  \n But, upgrading is risky, especially with the cardinality estimator changes in SQL Server 2014. Testing for broken functionality isn&rsquo;t hard if the apps have good test coverage, but testing for performance has been really difficult.\n  \n Until now with Query Store.\n  \n Testing performance for the SQL Server 2016 upgrade is as easy as restoring a copy of the DB to a testing server, enabling Query Store, running the workload under old and new compatibility levels, and then using the built-in Query Store reports to identify queries that experienced performance regressions. What could take days of work to identify the regressions in previous versions, can now be done by looking at a single built in report. In some cases, fixing the performance regression may also be easily done with Query Store, using the plan forcing feature.\n  \n That was the story at RTM, a compelling case for upgrading, and a feature that makes it far easier to test for that upgrade than ever before.\n  \n Then SP1 was released.\n  \n The big news of SP1 wasn&rsquo;t the new features it had, though the features were interesting. The big news of SP1 was about the Enterprise edition-only features, like Columnstore indexes, In-Memory OLTP, Partitioning, Compression and several more.\n  \n As of SQL Server 2016 SP1, those Enterprise-only programmability features are available in all editions, right down to Express.\n  \n This makes SQL Server 2016 a must-have upgrade for anyone using Standard edition of any lower version. Upgrade to SQL Server 2016 standard edition, apply SP1 and get a whole pile of features that were previously only available in Enterprise Edition.\n  \n But there&rsquo;s more. SP1 also included some nice features itself, including a way to clone a database without data in a single statement, a more flexible hinting model for queries, more DMVs for monitoring what SQL Server is doing and the addition of the CREATE OR ALTER syntax for stored procedures, functions, views, and triggers, which makes deployment scripts simpler.\n  \n This is one of the best versions of SQL Server in a long time, and upgrading to it should be on almost every IT department&rsquo;s roadmap for this year.&quot;}">

A Raspberry Pi Jam is an organised community event where people get together and share knowledge, learn new things and meet other Raspberry Pi enthusiasts. This particular event was structured as a show and tell, meaning that participants were given the opportunity to demonstrate their Pi projects and discuss them with other like-minded Pi enthusiasts.\n  \n Jointly hosted by RS Components and Entelect Software, nine Pi projects were presented and the event kicked off with a keynote address by Eben Upton, the illustrious inventor of the Raspberry Pi.\n  \n Upton&rsquo;s address, provided the guests with an insight into the initial concept of the Pi and the start-up phase of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. He explained that the idea of the Raspberry Pi came about in trying to solve a particular problem which was to boost an interest in computer programming and STEM learning in young learners. The concept was to create an affordable computer at $35, which needed to be both functional and simple enough for a child to learn coding. The team initially envisioned selling 1000 Raspberry Pi boards, but demand peaked quite rapidly to 10 000 boards and 5 years later they have sold over 15 million units around the world.\n  \n During the event, RS Components and Entelect Software representatives shared their expert knowledge with the participants to provide some insight on where to next with each of the projects presented. Projects were judged by a panel according to predetermined criteria, such as, novelty, creativity, technology choices, user experience, simplicity and future potential.\n  \n Second place went to Gareth Stephenson, who presented his &lsquo;Pi Cluster&rsquo; project which tested the concept of cluster computing using Raspberry Pis.\n  \n Third place went to: Schalk van Heerden with his &lsquo;Cherry Pi Brewery&rsquo; project which is a prototype concept for a fully automated micro-brewery.\n  \n Other notable projects were:\n A self-driving car, developed by Philip Booysen.\n An offline library developed for underprivileged students, designed by Yoshiaki Nagasawa, a Japanese student, currently living in Cape Town.\n  \n Explaining where the idea came from to host the first Raspberry Jam in South Africa, Brian Andrew, General Manager, RS Components South Africa, said: &ldquo;Since the day the Raspberry Pi was launched in South Africa in 2012, it was an instant hit with design engineers, makers and anyone who loves tech gadgets because of its cost and the fact that it functions as a mini computer.

Actually, the security researcher who exposed the breach &ndash; let&rsquo;s call them the Hunt Files, after the researcher &ndash; expects this number to be a lot higher. It&rsquo;s a very real possibility that our information is on that list: our ID numbers, names, addresses, genders, birth dates, ethnicities, occupations, marital status and more.\n \n Greatest threat\n \n The hack has brought cybersecurity into the spotlight once again. South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide and loses more than R2.2 billion to internet fraud and phishing attacks annually, according to the South African Banking Risk Information Centre. Gartner predicts that cybercrime might become the greatest threat to every person, place and thing in the world within the next five years.\n \n Clearly, something has to change.\n \n Enter the blockchain, a shared, digital, decentralised, secure online ledger that facilitates online transactions &ndash; and not just monetary ones. Had the Hunt Files been stored on the blockchain, the hack would never have happened.\n \n Here&rsquo;s why:\n \n Decentralised\n \n The Hunt Files were stored on a central database with questionable security, which is why it was possible to access all the information easily and in one go.\n \n The blockchain is stored on a decentralised database &ndash; the blockchain, comprising thousands &ndash; if not hundreds of thousands &ndash; of nodes, scattered all over the world. An attacker will need to control more than 51% of the nodes in order to compromise the database, and the chance of that happening is virtually impossible.\n \n Secure\n \n The blockchain uses public-key cryptography, which is one of the strongest form of encryptions available today. It&rsquo;s used to secure websites, certificates and just about everything on the Internet. Together with the decentralised nature of the blockchain, this means that not even the combined power of the world&rsquo;s supercomputers could crack the chain. It has stood the test of time for the past nine years, securing hundreds of billions of dollars\n \n Without the blockchain, our data is &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by hundreds of different service providers &ndash; banks, telcos, e-commerce stores and more. This means our information is stored on potentially thousands of different databases that, hopefully, have robust security in place. Clearly, some don&rsquo;t.\n \n Power shift\n \n With the blockchain &ndash; and with apps like Civic &ndash; consumers regain control of their data. They decide who can access it, for what purposes and for how long. And, when we no longer need the service (e.g. we switch banks), we take our information with us, rather than leaving a copy of it on the bank&rsquo;s database.\n \n Civic makes it as easy to log into a website as it is to log in with Facebook, except our information is stored on our phones and not in a public database. When we log in with Civic, we scan a barcode on the website that allows the site to only access the bare minimum information. If it only needs our email address to log in, that&rsquo;s all it gets. If we were to log in with Facebook, we share a lot more about ourselves than the site needs to know &ndash; like personal information, interests and connections.\n \n From next year, Civic will be able to process Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) requests, making it a viable option for quick, cheap and secure compliance and regulatory verifications.\n \n Challenges\n \n The biggest challenge hampering the wide scale uptake of the blockchain is throughput. The fastest blockchain platforms currently available can process around 1,000 transactions a second. When we first started using blockchain for transaction processing, it could only handle around seven transactions &ndash; making it ideal for the processing of cryptocurrency transactions at the time.\n \n While we&rsquo;ve come a long way in a short space of time, we&rsquo;re still far from the 40,000 transactions processed every second by the likes of Visa and Mastercard. But at the current rate of development, we anticipate serious contenders by the end of 2018.\n \n Start now, start here\n \n Many people still believe that the blockchain only has financial applications. But because of the reduced cost and ease of developing decentralised apps (Dapps), we&rsquo;re already seeing a lot more use cases, across every industry, including government, healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain and identify verification.\n \n Like the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the blockchain is going to radically change many industries, and now is as good a time as any for businesses to start exploring its use cases and opportunities &ndash; especially if they&rsquo;re still running their operations on legacy infrastructure.\n \n Before embarking on a blockchain project, ensure your team has the skills to develop Dapps and that they understand cryptography. Chances are, if you handle any kind of sensitive information, the blockchain will provide an unmatched level of security and user control, helping you to meet governance requirements and to gain the trust of your customers.\n \n The blockchain is going to fundamentally challenge traditional power structures by giving control of information back to the consumer. Innovating in this space is a business&rsquo; best defence mechanism.

This is because a machine will almost always be better in performance at jobs of this nature. Equally however, with the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, jobs involving architecting systems, and systems maintenance, will become more important.

As we get better at building these systems, a more general intelligence similar to the human mind becomes more realistic.\n  \n In the longer term, individuals who want to remain relevant and an asset to their organisation need to undergo a mind shift. Fundamentally, it all comes down to one thing: Innovation and future thinking.\n  \n By being open to change and harnessing it for the benefit of the organisation, every person can be an asset. Being stuck in a traditional way of thinking and doing things quickly becomes a hindrance to innovation. Often, an organisation can operate fine, unaware of its sloth, until it&rsquo;s disrupted by another organisation that embraces innovation. By that time, it&rsquo;s too late. Companies need to invest in skunk works, or at least the culture that encourages people to innovate from within because organisations also have a role to play in developing the skills of the future.\n  \n Being open to rethinking the way we work, the value we add, and the vision we work towards is almost expected for the future of an organisation.

Fundamentally, it all comes down to one thing: Innovation and future thinking.<br /><br />By being open to change and harnessing it for the benefit of the organisation, every person can be an asset. Being stuck in a traditional way of thinking and doing things quickly becomes a hindrance to innovation. Often, an organisation can operate fine, unaware of its sloth, until it&rsquo;s disrupted by another organisation that embraces innovation. By that time, it&rsquo;s too late. Companies need to invest in skunk works, or at least the culture that encourages people to innovate from within because organisations also have a role to play in developing the skills of the future.<br /><br />Being open to rethinking the way we work, the value we add, and the vision we work towards is almost expected for the future of an organisation. Be part of the revolution, or be consumed by it.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;4 ways to future-proof your IoT solution, and avoid obsolescence.&quot;}">4 ways to future-proof your IoT solution, and avoid obsolescence.</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving rapidly and it&rsquo;s difficult to say what things may look like in a year or two, much less in the next decade. One of the biggest concerns for organisations is buying what soon becomes functionally or technologically obsolete, but continually deferring to invest in IoT could lead to analysis paralysis.\n  \n Organisations understanding the use cases and potential of IoT are the organisations that will likely drive innovation over the next decade. IoT is enabling businesses in numerous industries to prevail &ndash; especially industries you would not typically associate with this technology. Manufacturing plants are using machine learning and smart sensors in their manufacturing process, farmers are using IoT to meet growing agricultural demands, and oil and gas companies use IoT devices to optimise drilling procedures.\n  \n The below graph showcases the worldwide IoT spend per industry in 2015, as well as the predicted spend for 2020.\n  \n  \n  \n The biggest spenders over the last few years have been the manufacturing and logistics industries, due to the fact that the industrial world comes with decades of legacy equipment and existing infrastructure that cannot be replaced easily or cost effectively. After dealing with the replacement and integration of legacy systems, how are these industries ensuring successful IoT adoption while still avoiding obsolescence?\n  \n Unlike more established technologies, the immature and fast-evolving nature of IoT solutions increases the risk of early obsolescence. In the age of IoT cloud-based solutions, future-proofing is a continuous process to maximise solution adaptability, while still managing risk.\n  \n Below are four considerations to keep in mind to ensure a future-proofed IoT landscape.\n  \n 1. Security\nMasses of data means masses of potential security threats\nThere&rsquo;s a quip that goes: The &lsquo;S&rsquo; in IoT stands for &lsquo;security&rsquo;. This is because IoT adoption is widely criticised for the lack of security. Having an IoT solution that does not start with security as first priority &ndash; addressing authentication, authorisation, and encryption of data &ndash; will not only lead to obsolescence, but will also risk putting the entire solution at risk. Future-proofing your IoT security will ensure that customers&rsquo; personal details don&rsquo;t get leaked.\n  \n 2. Scalability\nIoT solutions should be based on horizontally scaling architectures\nWith the IoT wave growing quicker than expected, there has not only been an increase in devices, but also an increase in the amount of data that is being transferred. There are many considerations that go into building up an IoT infrastructure that can scale, but there&rsquo;s a lot more to consider than simply scaling servers. Designing an infrastructure that can scale will help ensure the success of the business that is built upon it.\n  \n 3. Flexibility\nRapidly adopt new devices, protocols and integration\nAs more IoT applications emerge, architectures need to be flexible enough to adapt to varying requirements and feature sets. There will undoubtably be new devices entering your ecosystem and your IoT solution must be prepared to handle those devices. A lack of flexibility will result in the rapid aging and obsolescence of your system.\n  \n 4. Portability\nA single deployment model is not enough\nThe universal shift to the cloud is challenging for many large enterprises. For those looking to build future-proof IoT, leveraging cloud-based technologies and the application of real-time data analysis can enable autonomous decision-making, and create the potential for new services and revenue streams.\n  \n Fortunately, the frameworks provided by major technology players have recently matured. The Platform-as-a-Service offerings from Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apache are now truly production ready.

<div>The Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving rapidly and it&rsquo;s difficult to say what things may look like in a year or two, much less in the next decade. One of the biggest concerns for organisations is buying what soon becomes functionally or technologically obsolete, but continually deferring to invest in IoT could lead to analysis paralysis.<br /><br />Organisations understanding the use cases and potential of IoT are the organisations that will likely drive innovation over the next decade. IoT is enabling businesses in numerous industries to prevail &ndash; especially industries you would not typically associate with this technology. Manufacturing plants are using machine learning and smart sensors in their manufacturing process, farmers are using IoT to meet growing agricultural demands, and oil and gas companies use IoT devices to optimise drilling procedures.<br /><br />The below graph showcases the worldwide IoT spend per industry in 2015, as well as the predicted spend for 2020.<br /><br /><br /><br />The biggest spenders over the last few years have been the manufacturing and logistics industries, due to the fact that the industrial world comes with decades of legacy equipment and existing infrastructure that cannot be replaced easily or cost effectively. After dealing with the replacement and integration of legacy systems, how are these industries ensuring successful IoT adoption while still avoiding obsolescence?<br /><br />Unlike more established technologies, the immature and fast-evolving nature of IoT solutions increases the risk of early obsolescence. In the age of IoT cloud-based solutions, future-proofing is a continuous process to maximise solution adaptability, while still managing risk.<br /><br />Below are four considerations to keep in mind to ensure a future-proofed IoT landscape.<br /><br />1. Security<br />Masses of data means masses of potential security threats<br />There&rsquo;s a quip that goes: The &lsquo;S&rsquo; in IoT stands for &lsquo;security&rsquo;. This is because IoT adoption is widely criticised for the lack of security. Having an IoT solution that does not start with security as first priority &ndash; addressing authentication, authorisation, and encryption of data &ndash; will not only lead to obsolescence, but will also risk putting the entire solution at risk. Future-proofing your IoT security will ensure that customers&rsquo; personal details don&rsquo;t get leaked.<br /><br />2. Scalability<br />IoT solutions should be based on horizontally scaling architectures<br />With the IoT wave growing quicker than expected, there has not only been an increase in devices, but also an increase in the amount of data that is being transferred. There are many considerations that go into building up an IoT infrastructure that can scale, but there&rsquo;s a lot more to consider than simply scaling servers. Designing an infrastructure that can scale will help ensure the success of the business that is built upon it.<br /><br />3. Flexibility<br />Rapidly adopt new devices, protocols and integration<br />As more IoT applications emerge, architectures need to be flexible enough to adapt to varying requirements and feature sets. There will undoubtably be new devices entering your ecosystem and your IoT solution must be prepared to handle those devices. A lack of flexibility will result in the rapid aging and obsolescence of your system.<br /><br />4. Portability<br />A single deployment model is not enough<br />The universal shift to the cloud is challenging for many large enterprises. For those looking to build future-proof IoT, leveraging cloud-based technologies and the application of real-time data analysis can enable autonomous decision-making, and create the potential for new services and revenue streams.<br /><br />Fortunately, the frameworks provided by major technology players have recently matured. The Platform-as-a-Service offerings from Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apache are now truly production ready. They have a large amount of infrastructure, data and network heavy-lifting available out the box, and pre-configured solutions available for other areas in some instances. There are essentially fewer breaking changes which would affect your product, so there has never been a better time to pursue an IoT solution.<br /><br />Future-proofing your IoT infrastructure is achievable as long as your organisation is thoroughly prepared for the changes that IoT brings, or you have an expert technology partner who can guide you through these four critical aspects.<br /><br />Entelect is an end-to-end technology services provider delivering custom software across all industry sectors.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Working with data is messy and getting it ready for any kind of model building is a painstaking and time-consuming process. Building feature stores is meant to optimize this process for all machine learning teams in an organization.\n\nThe concept of a feature store is growing in popularity with Uber introducing the concept in 2017 as part of the data management layer in their machine learning platform, Michelangelo. Netflix used a similar concept called a feature encoder in their time machine, Delorean. Other companies embracing feature stores include Linkedin and Airbnb.\n  \n What is a feature store?\n \nA feature store is a curated collection of pre-computed features, stored in a centralized location. Features are calculated by joining raw data sources and transforming them into formats that can be interpreted by machine learning models. They are then stored under descriptive names in a central location, making them identifiable and accessible to the teams using them.\n \nIn addition to storing the features, the feature store has the functionality to continuously update the feature calculations as new data is added and track that data lineage. They also have the functionality to create new features and backfill them using the historical data.\n \nBut what is it for?\n \nData scientists at Airbnb spend up to 60% of their time engineering features to be used for machine learning and Uber says during model training the most time is spent transforming and selecting features. Creating these features is a fundamental part of the machine learning workflow but also a an inefficient one.\n \nFeature stores solve several problems in the machine learning workflow:\n \n1. If features are calculated ad-hoc as part of the pipeline, they are difficult to reuse across different pipelines. This wastes time and resources during the experimentation phase. Feature stores standardize how features are accessed and make them reusable across pipelines and teams.\n \n2. It allows teams to share insights by including new features that they have found useful in the store.\n \n3. Feature stores also create a consistency in data. Various teams may unknowingly be creating the same features, a waste of resources but also various implementations may produce different results obscuring the definition and understanding of the feature to the teams and the company.\n \n4. Features are automatically updated when new data comes in, but the data lineage is tracked. This way teams do not have to redo all the calculations to update their features, but they can still replicate experiments from before data updates occur. This is important for explaining model decisions and tracking model performance over time.\n \n5. Features calculated during the experimentation phase in the data scientists preferred language may not be perfectly replicable in the production system. This causes an inconsistency in the features used for training and those calculated for live predictions. Performance of a model is then difficult to measure accurately until it is deployed, which can be a costly mistake.\n \nThe feature store makes it possible for teams to search through a catalogue of features for what they need. Teams can gain insight from other teams by browsing the existing features or sharing their own when they add new ones. The time saved on feature engineering can then be dedicated to model building. Since this is a very experimental process, the time added to the model building phase allows more ideas to be tested and a better solution built.\n \nOff-the-shelf or custom-built?\n \nNetflix, Uber, and Airbnb have all created their own custom feature store implementations. Since these companies were at the forefront, they did not have an off-the-shelf solution available to them. However, not every company needs a completely custom-built option and now there are off-the-shelf options available. Open-source feature store services are available from Hopsworks and Feast with Airbnb planning to open source their solution, Zipline, in the future.\n \nBuilding a reliable, speedy feature store could be a massive undertaking as it will need to malleable enough to create new features and backfill them, produce the results in a reasonable amount of time and be queryable from multiple platforms and finally be accessible to both offline sandboxes and online deployed models.\n \nOff-the-shelf options are faster to get up and running and will show return on investment sooner, but they are still quite new and there isn&rsquo;t feedback yet on how they are doing within organisations that have adopted them.\n  \n Want to read more?\n Feature Store: the missing data layer in ML pipelines?: https://www.logicalclocks.com/feature-store/\nIntroducing Feast: https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-feast-5eb4d539c13f\nMeet Michelangelo: Uber&rsquo;s Machine Learning Platform: https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/\nDistributed Time Travel for Feature Generation: https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/distributed-time-travel-for-feature-generation-389cccdd3907&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:4663,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://https://www.logicalclocks.com/feature-store/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4708}{&quot;1&quot;:4727,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-feast-5eb4d539c13f&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4789}{&quot;1&quot;:4843,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4877}{&quot;1&quot;:4926,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:5021}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;DevOps is a cultural shift. It&rsquo;s not a matter of simply adopting agile planning or continuous delivery, although those practices are certainly important. Creating a DevOps culture in your organisation is about having shared understanding, communication and collaboration between software engineers and operations, and sharing responsibility for the software they build.\n  \n Creating such an environment is a challenge. It requires assessing and realigning how people think about their teams, the business, and the customers. People don&rsquo;t often welcome change, but it is doable by following these four steps to developing a strong and effective DevOps culture in your organisation.\n  \n 1. Get leadership on board\nEnsuring you have management buy-in is the first step. Without it everything else will fail. Bringing DevOps into your organisation involves cultural changes that are usually more difficult for management to adapt to than staff. Taking a DevOps approach requires being comfortable working more transparently and requires management to be comfortable with seeing certain team failures as growth opportunities. A top-down approach to initiating a DevOps culture is the ideal way to ensure that teams experience smooth integration.\n  \n 2. Start simple\nAs with adopting any new practices, it&rsquo;s important not to overwhelm teams with sudden, unmanageable changes. Explore the DevOps process with a viable pilot project and constantly field feedback from team members along the way. This will allow you to encourage collaboration between teams and introduce reliable measurements to frequently improve before rolling it out to bigger projects.\n  \n 3. Use DevOps to create a culture of growth\nImplementing a DevOps culture is an opportunity to grow team members, expand skillsets and expand responsibilities. Ensuring end-to-end responsibility for products is essential in an integrated team environment. This will allow software engineers to not just do repetitive coding, but to take more accountability for the whole solution including infrastructure, support and tooling.\n  \n 4. Break down silos\nEncourage forming horizontal connections in your company to break down silos, and increase transparency, communication and collaboration across teams. Discussions between teams lead to valuable insights and inputs into the development process, allowing teams to avoid certain issues and inefficiencies right from the get-go. Great software is built by great teams, which are built on great relationships. It drives down response times and pushes sprint velocity (and talent retention) up.\n  \n  \n  \n Teams who get DevOps right have done so on the back of a strong, reliable culture, driving them to take accountability and ownership of the end product. This culture has to be supported by managers who are willing to learn alongside their teams.

Humans are great at stringing together complex concepts and harnessing them towards a goal. With that in mind, we&rsquo;re also moulded by our culture, upbringing, and history. This introduces bias in all humans.\n  \n AI systems are only as good as the data we use to mould them. This all stems from people deciding what data is captured, how it is captured, and to an extent, how it is interpreted. With the upsurge of AI in human-centric areas, such as hiring, finance, and criminal justice, society has started to wrestle with just how much human biases can make their way into these systems.\n  \n How AI bias happens\nBad data can contain implicit racial, gender, or ideological biases, and many AI systems will continue to be trained using biased or flawed data, making this an ongoing problem. AI bias is often explained by a poor understanding of the domain, data, and how it&rsquo;s being used. The reality is, bias can creep in long before the data is collected, as well as at many other stages of the machine learning process. Some of these stages include:\n  \n 1. The data collection stage\nThere are two main ways that bias shows up in training data: either the data collected is not an accurate representation of reality, or it reflects existing prejudices. If a deep-learning algorithm receives more photos of light-skinned faces versus darker-skinned , a facial recognition system would inevitably be worse at recognising darker-skinned faces since it has few examples to learn from. Addressing the second case would be Amazon&rsquo;s internal recruiting tool that dismissed female candidates. Because the system was trained on historical hiring decisions, which favoured men over women , it learned to do the same.\n  \n 2. The data preparations stage\nThe data preparation stage involves selecting which data or attributes of the data can be engineered into features you want the algorithm to consider when learning. Examples of &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; could be a customer&rsquo;s age, location, income, gender, education level or years of experience. Choosing which attributes to consider or ignore can significantly influence a model&rsquo;s prediction accuracy but also introduce bias. Individuals from previously disadvantaged backgrounds may be discriminated against due to a combination of attributes without intentionally doing so.\n  \n  \n  \n Why AI bias is not an easy fix\nBecause AI is not a brand-new discovery, it is often believed that most problems should have been ironed out by now. But due to the complexity of AI biases and ever-changing technology and social landscapes, it&rsquo;s not an easy fix. The truth is &ndash; you don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know. This is probably the biggest complexity organisations have to deal with when trying to identify and solve biases in systems.\n  \n The introduction of bias isn&rsquo;t always obvious during a model&rsquo;s construction because you may not realise the downstream impacts of your data and choices until much later. Once biases are discovered, it&rsquo;s difficult to identify where it came from and how to get rid of it. Similarly, the way in which engineers and scientists are taught to frame problems often isn&rsquo;t compatible with the best way to think about social problems. It&rsquo;s also not clear what the absence of bias should look like.\n  \n Most foundational laws and regulations were established in a different time, where the digital world didn&rsquo;t exist. There have been instances of governing bodies adapting laws to try battle AI biases and information privacy, but it&rsquo;s not always easy to keep up with rapidly advancing technologies. Laws and regulations struggle to keep up with the pace of new technologies and their uses that are constantly erupting and evolving.\n  \n Where to from here?\nFortunately, a strong group of AI researchers are working hard to address the problem.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The exponential growth of digital products and services means more data being gathered than ever before: customers, usage, patterns, and problems. With this growth, we have needed to store and manage it all, but more importantly, to figure out how to learn and benefit from it. This has driven the increasing popularity and desire to incorporate machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science into most new generation systems and products, these big data projects are often ambitious, and often failures.\n  \n Industry is scrambling to capitalise on this data, causing a surge in demand for skilled data scientists, engineers and developers who can curate, store, process and analyse data. However, according to a Gartner report, at least 60% of big data projects fail to even move past preliminary stages, but it&rsquo;s predicted that these numbers could be closer to 85%. The overwhelming hype has led to unreasonable expectations from the business, and change is outpacing the production of competent professionals.\n  \n  \n  \n Even though only a fraction of data science and analytics models that are developed actually make it into production usage, technology is not the only point of failure. In fact, technology is a minor cause of failure relative to the real culprits. We unpack 5 key reasons why big data projects fail below.\n  \n 1. Data science weekend warriors\nDue to the growing hype around data, there has been an influx of interested people that are learning and practicing data science without experience. They can churn out something that looks great but isn&rsquo;t necessarily accurate, and they struggle to productionalise it. They lack the theoretical background to understand which algorithms to use, and why certain algorithms work or don&rsquo;t work in each context. Their exposure is generally a narrow portion of ML, limited to pet projects or data that they&rsquo;ve been exposed to.\n  \n 2. Productionalisation problems\nSome data science is only meant for hypothesis testing and doesn&rsquo;t need to be taken into production, but there are still multiple data science projects that do need to be productionalised. These projects fail when they can&rsquo;t be productionalised due to data pipeline issues. Most data scientists want to deal with the &lsquo;fun and attractive&rsquo; model building, without taking time to understand the end-to-end process. This leads to hacked together 'production' solutions that often fail and contribute to the large pool of unsuccessful projects in industry.\n  \n 3. Lack of data engineer skillsets\nEveryone wants to be a data scientist but very few want to be data engineers. Typically, the industry needs double the amount of data engineers to data scientists, since around 60% of the work is prepping and pipelining data, and only 30% is covered in areas like machine learning. The skillset for data engineers is also quite different from that of data scientists, and much closer to a traditional software engineer, mixed with DevOps and the understanding of ML algorithms.\n  \n 4. Lack of customer buy-in\nDue to the above issues, customers have been burnt by unsuccessful data science projects and are wary to offer their support. Badly productionalised solutions end up costing businesses more money than anticipated, weekend warriors who lack proper skill and experience take longer to reach a conclusion with their projects, and the lack of engineer skills makes deriving value from these projects more difficult.\n  \n 5. Expecting ML to be a silver bullet\nThere is a common misconception that machine learning can do anything with any data. This lack of understanding of the meaningful use cases for ML can cause friction and unmet expectations. ML has its place, but if you aren&rsquo;t sure what you want, any road will get you there. The proliferation of data makes this even more difficult, because people think data implies ML, without understanding the quality of the data and the problem they&rsquo;re trying to address.\n  \n  \n  \n As more organisations turn to AI, ML and data science to drive decision making, introduce new products and maximise resources, the more important it becomes to ensure the success of big data projects. To avoid adding to the growing statistic of failed initiatives, businesses need to have a realistic data strategy in place to prepare for and avoid these pitfalls.\n  \n Recruit or partner with experienced data professionals who have a proven track record of successful data projects. Do enough preparation and research before rushing models into production, and promote cross-skilling within your organisation to help fight the data skills gap. If you&rsquo;re still having trouble with gaining customer buy-in, move slower and stay involved to ensure you remain on the right path. Finally, recognise that ML (or any data approach for that matter) is not a silver bullet, and time needs to be invested to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches before starting data projects without clear direction.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://designingforanalytics.com/resources/failure-rates-for-analytics-bi-iot-and-big-data-projects-85-yikes/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:760,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://designingforanalytics.com/resources/failure-rates-for-analytics-bi-iot-and-big-data-projects-85-yikes/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:789}">

We ran custom development projects for about 25 active clients at any one time, with a healthy spread of JAVA and .NET projects.

This business is maturing with the appointment of our first four Resellers who include Entelect ERP (a Sage reseller), Cyclenation (Australia), Advendurance and Baobab International. \n\nEntelect Placements continues to deliver solid results with a comfortable 5% of turnover despite a small team. We expect steady growth for 2011 and will focus on the delivery of quality professional people to our clients.\n\nEntelect Training, which is in its infancy, will be taking a grassroots approach by launching a distance learning solution for school children in the next couple of months. The focus will be on laying the foundations with maths and over time will lead into tertiary level training for software engineers. Of course, we will continue to provide customised training courses for our Software clients and partners.\n\nOur investment in research and development will be significant this year, and we look forward to delivering innovative software solutions to large, medium and small enterprises, both locally and abroad, so expect a few exciting announcements down the line.\n\nWe wish all our clients and partners a profitable and healthy year ahead!&quot;}">

A little extra effort and foresight will go a long way in seeing that the ultimate AI player makes it through to the finals! <br /><br />The tournament play-offs will be hosted on the 28th of September to a closed audience of entrants. These initial rounds will see players paired off in a double-elimination style tournament with only the superior AI players progressing to later rounds. To add to the excitement, the final rounds will be hosted LIVE on the main stage at rAge expo on the 6th of October in-front of 20 000 attendees. The event will also be broadcast live on the internet for all to see thanks to NAG Online. With a closing date of 24th September there is still plenty of time to get your engines started. </a><a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accept the challenge today</a>!</div>

We are happy to announce that the following contenders will be going through to the finals and will stand a chance to win the grand prize of R100 000 at rAge!<br /><br />G-J van Rooyen (scalvin)<br />Jan Gutter (The Dalek)<br />Jaco Cronje (JC)<br />Hendrik Coetzee (demaniak)<br />Werner Stoop (Wernsey)<br />Marius Potgieter (Monkey)<br />Pierre Pretorius (Pierre)<br />Lucas Dreyer (Lucas)<br /><br />For more information visit the Challenge Page</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lsquo;Every year we handpick and hire about 20 of the top BSc Computer Science, Engineering and BCom Information Systems graduates from all mainstream universities around the country for the Graduate BootCamp. The graduates attend intensive training for two months while on full salaries. After this, they work on client projects free of charge for three months under the mentorship of our team leads. At the end of this period, clients are given the opportunity to retain them on our projects at our standard junior rates,&rsquo; says Entelect MD, Shashi Hansjee.\n Entelect CEO, Dr Charles Pritchard &lsquo;Our clients benefit as they get to work with the country&rsquo;s top graduates on a risk-free basis for an initial period before they commit. Our graduates escalate their technical careers, while our seniors also benefit personally from from helping junior colleagues in the specialist areas that they are most passionate about.&rsquo;\n The BootCamp course covers both the practical and theoretical side of business analysis, programming concepts, Microsoft.NET, Java Enterprise Edition and SQL development. All graduates work through this full syllabus, regardless of which solutions stream they will be working on, giving them a rounded understanding of the full software development life cycle. &lsquo;By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they will have collaborated to write components of systems in various languages and platforms, all of which would have been vetted and code-reviewed by various technical leads,&rsquo; says Hansjee. \n &lsquo;Of course there is a downside risk. It takes us about a year to recover our investment in each graduate, so if the graduate leaves early, we lose financially. That said, it&rsquo;s a risk with which we are comfortable as we go to great lengths to live up to our goal of being the best company in South Africa to work for. Despite the high demand for engineers, we manage to maintain high staff retention rates &ndash; not an easy task considering the dynamics of the industry,&rsquo; says Pritchard. \n Entelect&rsquo;s client base is amongst the best blue-chips in South Africa. Their appetite for the development of big custom systems that differentiate them in the marketplace keeps climbing, hence the demand for software engineers. The culture of ongoing training and mentorship that spans more than 15 career-enhancement programmes, is a real differentiator for Entelect employees. These range from leadership programmes to technology accelerators and specialist technical forums.\n  \n Asked about the current state of skills in South Africa, Pritchard says, &lsquo;There is a severe shortage of high-end software engineering skills in this country. Our problem is not the pursuit of new projects as word gets out that we consistently do a great job but instead, one of finding quality engineers to help us deliver on our order pipeline. If we could hire 30 people today, we would take them! Technology is becoming such an integral part of everyone&rsquo;s lives, and businesses simply cannot run without an innovation focus in this industry. We believe investing more in quality software engineering training programmes as a national priority, and if we don&rsquo;t embrace it as an industry and government collective, we as a nation will lose out on the significant employment opportunities available in the IT sector.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The keynote was on the architecture and infrastructure of SQL Azure&hellip; or whatever it&rsquo;s named this week. The architecture is fascinating, as is their attitude to failure. They use commodity hardware, not server-grade hardware. This naturally makes failures more common. They expect failure and they actually plan for it.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a very different design from most on-premises data centres, where a failure is a major problem. With the Azure data centres, a hardware failure may be left unattended to for up to two weeks. The architecture is built around the concept of &lsquo;self-healing&rsquo;. Servers that fail are simply left until the next scheduled maintenance. Any databases that are affected by the failed server have a new replica built, completely transparently. There&rsquo;s a complex quorum mechanism to ensure that only up-to-date replicas are used. Writes are done to all replicas and reads can be done from any synchronised replica.\n\nAfter the keynote (and fresh coffee), Denny Cherry dived into SQL Server&rsquo;s Availability Groups, detailing the features, limitations and improvements in SQL 2014. He also covered a few case studies, implementations of both the SQL 2012 version and the SQL 2014 version. A complete start-to-finish demo of setting up an Availability Group finished that session.\n\nAfter Denny&rsquo;s session, it was final checks and rehearsal for my first session.This session on database corruption was to a fairly small audience. Lots and lots of questions though &ndash; I ended up skipping the last couple of slides because of all the questions!\n\n\n\nWhich reminds me, I still need to check whether the statement in Books Online, which states that checksum is always enabled for compressed backups, is actually correct&hellip; I have a vague recollection that either the statement is incorrect or there are some other caveats. By the time I finished with all the questions and discussions afterwards, the last session of the day was well underway and both sessions I wanted to go to were full &ndash; thankfully, there are always the recordings! Instead, I ended up spending the rest of the afternoon chatting with Brent Ozar and a few other MVPs in the coffee area, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nFriday evening was the SQLBits party. The steampunk theme was appropriate for a conference venue, which is near to where the industrial revolution began. Long coats, hats and goggles were in abundance. While some made just a token attempt at a costume, some came decked out to the nines.\n\nSaturday started with a session on T-SQL tricks by Itzik Ben-Gan. Itzik is always full of fun new techniques and this session was no exception. All of the tips were around the Windowing functions (Row_Number, Rank, etc.) along with their SQL 2012 enhancements, LEAD, LAG and the window bounds definitions. Half of the tips he showed us were ways of handling complicated &lsquo;gaps and islands&rsquo; type problems, where a data set has a sequential series of numbers with gaps, and the rows need to be &lsquo;grouped&rsquo; into sets delimited by the gaps in the sequence. This used to be a very difficult problem before the introduction of the windowing functions but now it&rsquo;s fairly trivial.\n\nAfter Itzik&rsquo;s session, it was time for final prep (and more coffee) for my session on problematic execution plans. I thought this session went very well, better than the corruption one &ndash; the room was packed. There weren&rsquo;t too many questions, which was good as there was a lot of material to get through. That said, there were quite a few questions after the session, so I missed Steve Jones&rsquo; session, which I&rsquo;d hoped to attend&hellip; more recordings to get!\n\nAfter lunch, it was time to sit in Brent Ozar&rsquo;s session on hardware choices for SQL Server. He made some very valid points about SANs no longer being the only option for high-end SQL Server machines, something that should be kept in mind when planning new servers. SANs are expensive and, if not configured properly for SQL Server, can become a serious bottleneck. With the price of enterprise-grade SSDs dropping and the improvements in SMB 3, internal storage or a NAS built with SSDs may be comparable in price with a SAN but they perform much better. Staying to chat with Brett about hardware and his experiences with large corporates meant I missed the last session. Still, the sessions are all recorded and the chat with Brett was really valuable. By the end of the day, the strain was getting to some&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t help that the demand on the coffee machines had resulted in three out of the four breaking down. \n\nAll in all, it was a very well-run, well-organised conference, with interesting sessions and good presenters. Because all the sessions were recorded (video camera and desktop capture) it meant there wasn&rsquo;t massive pressure to attend a session if there was an opportunity instead to chat directly with any of the (many) MVPs and MCMs who were there.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Primarily, DevDay is a platform for staff collaboration and the promotion of unique ideas. The day focuses on employees&rsquo; pet projects and any projects they are interested in in their spare time. There are also demonstrations of new and exciting frameworks, discussions around the technologies used on projects as well as the process around development or operations. \n\nFor the first time, DevDay was extended to include presentation stands and specialist speakers on a wide range of topics. The day was incredibly beneficial to all who attended &ndash; below is some feedback from attendees and speakers.\n\n\nName: Rushil O&rsquo;Jageer \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nI am always excited to attend the Entelect DevDays. DevDays give me the opportunity to learn about all the innovative stuff I&rsquo;m not exposed to on a daily basis, giving me a foundation from which I can work and explore further. The fact that we get 1-UP points for attending also helps. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D Program Rishal presented and the cool technologies you can use to create CMS, presented by Matt. Rishal stood out as the best presenter &ndash; his delivery was so engaging that I lost all track of time. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more around mobile development.\n\nName: Charles Okot \nDesignation: Software Engineer\nI see DevDay as an opportunity to get together with teams we barely come into contact with and see all the innovative stuff everyone else is busy with. I learned so much from this DevDay &ndash; there are plenty of things we don&rsquo;t know about! I thought the full CMS and that 3D Programming is available in the browsing was awesome! For me, Matt stood out as the best speaker and his presentation was very impressive. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more cutting-edge ways in which we can do our jobs. \n\nName: Megan Van Rooyen \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nThis was my first DevDay and it was a great chance for people to show off the innovations they are busy with outside of work and boots. The 3D GS, Web GL and Team Building presentations impressed me. I learned how to use JavaScript Libraries and Browser-use, too. For me, Rishal stood out as the best presenter. He presented on new innovations in a way that everyone could understand. For the next DevDay, I would like to see something on Oculus Rift and Google Phone Blocks. \n\nName: Joe Niemand \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nDevDay gives me time to join the rest of the team and find out all about new technologies and calibration. It&rsquo;s an incredible chance to learn and also get some 1-UP points in one go! The presentation &lsquo;What Makes a Successful Team&rsquo; was brilliant. I learned what it takes to be a charismatic leader, which is a key factor in any successful team. For the next DevDay, I would like to see even more of the innovative ideas presented at every DevDay! \n\nName: Gail Shaw \nDesignation: Technical Lead \nDevDay is a break from the ordinary, giving people the opportunity to showcase &lsquo;not-so-serious&rsquo; presentations in a less formal setting. I enjoy attending DevDay because I am able to gain more presentation experience and practice, which helps me to improve on my presenting skills.

<div>Primarily, DevDay is a platform for staff collaboration and the promotion of unique ideas. The day focuses on employees&rsquo; pet projects and any projects they are interested in in their spare time. There are also demonstrations of new and exciting frameworks, discussions around the technologies used on projects as well as the process around development or operations. <br /><br />For the first time, DevDay was extended to include presentation stands and specialist speakers on a wide range of topics. The day was incredibly beneficial to all who attended &ndash; below is some feedback from attendees and speakers.<br /><br /><br />Name: Rushil O&rsquo;Jageer <br />Designation: Software Engineer <br />I am always excited to attend the Entelect DevDays. DevDays give me the opportunity to learn about all the innovative stuff I&rsquo;m not exposed to on a daily basis, giving me a foundation from which I can work and explore further. The fact that we get 1-UP points for attending also helps. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D Program Rishal presented and the cool technologies you can use to create CMS, presented by Matt. Rishal stood out as the best presenter &ndash; his delivery was so engaging that I lost all track of time. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more around mobile development.<br /><br />Name: Charles Okot <br />Designation: Software Engineer<br />I see DevDay as an opportunity to get together with teams we barely come into contact with and see all the innovative stuff everyone else is busy with. I learned so much from this DevDay &ndash; there are plenty of things we don&rsquo;t know about! I thought the full CMS and that 3D Programming is available in the browsing was awesome! For me, Matt stood out as the best speaker and his presentation was very impressive. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more cutting-edge ways in which we can do our jobs. <br /><br />Name: Megan Van Rooyen <br />Designation: Software Engineer <br />This was my first DevDay and it was a great chance for people to show off the innovations they are busy with outside of work and boots. The 3D GS, Web GL and Team Building presentations impressed me. I learned how to use JavaScript Libraries and Browser-use, too. For me, Rishal stood out as the best presenter. He presented on new innovations in a way that everyone could understand. For the next DevDay, I would like to see something on Oculus Rift and Google Phone Blocks. <br /><br />Name: Joe Niemand <br />Designation: Software Engineer <br />DevDay gives me time to join the rest of the team and find out all about new technologies and calibration. It&rsquo;s an incredible chance to learn and also get some 1-UP points in one go! The presentation &lsquo;What Makes a Successful Team&rsquo; was brilliant. I learned what it takes to be a charismatic leader, which is a key factor in any successful team. For the next DevDay, I would like to see even more of the innovative ideas presented at every DevDay! <br /><br />Name: Gail Shaw <br />Designation: Technical Lead <br />DevDay is a break from the ordinary, giving people the opportunity to showcase &lsquo;not-so-serious&rsquo; presentations in a less formal setting. I enjoy attending DevDay because I am able to gain more presentation experience and practice, which helps me to improve on my presenting skills. I was impressed with the automatic movie downloader and also came to realise that I can&rsquo;t read code!

With more than 200 technical sessions across three days, there is nothing else like it. As usual, there will be too much material packed into too little time, but all the sessions will be recorded and attendees can download them free of charge, so missing a session is not a major problem.\n\nI&rsquo;m presenting a 400-level session (classified &lsquo;Expert&rsquo; level) on the Friday afternoon. The session is on the internals of one aspect of the Query Optimiser &ndash; the Cardinality Estimator. The presentation is an expanded version of the one I did for the 24 Hours of PASS Summit Preview and goes into detail on how SQL Server estimates the number of rows that will be affected by a query operator, how it uses statistics to get accurate row estimations and what happens when it can&rsquo;t use the statistics. The idea of the presentation is that once people know how SQL Server generates the row estimations, they&rsquo;re much better equipped to solve problems when they encounter queries with incorrect row estimations. The session will be shown on PASStv and so anyone, whether they&rsquo;re attending or not, can watch it.\n\nThis year, PASS Summit is not the only conference in early November in Seattle.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The atmosphere was relaxed with many activities for staff to do at their own leisure, including water slides, volleyball, elephant experiences, game drives and massages. After presenting the internal R100K prizes and long-service awards, Entelect CEO \nDr Charles Pritchard outlined the year&rsquo;s highlights. \n\nThe company&rsquo;s highlights for 2014 include:  Turnover and profitability are up by 25 per cent compared with last year.\n Staff has grown by 20 per cent to 208 employees &ndash; this figure excludes the additional 31 graduates joining in January 2015.\n Client numbers and the size of engagements continue to grow, with the top five biggest project clients being Discovery, Liberty, Silica, FNB and Deloitte.\n Successful launches of various internal systems that allow for more growth in the business.\n Maturation of the existing management structures and also the addition of new management roles: data solutions and service delivery.\n Delivery of successful projects in the newly formed Tech Accelerator initiative, with further innovations planned for 2015.\n Entelect&rsquo;s Encentivize loyalty solution&rsquo;s numbers increased and the programme now hosts 84,000 end users, with new clients including Diners Club, Old Mutual and Deloitte. Significant growth is expected in this division for 2015.\n Entelect&rsquo;s MyActive events solutions hosted 96 events, which is a 43 percent jump compared with last year.\n In its annual survey Deloitte confirmed that Entelect is the best employer in Southern Africa in three categories, including the Best IT Company to Work For (all categories) &ndash; an excellent achievement considering the stature of the 160 companies that entered.\n Entelect CTO, Martin Naude, won an award as the world&rsquo;s best loyalty practitioner.\n Entelect featured in the press, with Entelect-related articles appearing in leading magazines and newspapers.\n Staff seamlessly moved to new offices, which will better accomodate the company&rsquo;s increasing staff.\n The Entelect Foundation has continued to grow, with 10 per cent of Entelect&rsquo;s profits being committed to social upliftment projects every year. Successes include putting a number of children through school, weekly mentorship by staff volunteers, issuing study scholarships, assisting families financially, running a feeding scheme for unemployed people; sponsorship of a new graphic design centre at the Frances Vorwerg school for the disabled, and donating 45 percent of the shares of Entelect's contracting company to a community development education trust.\n The hosting of many more events by the company's social committee throughout the year, from braais and sports events to family days.\n  \nBefore closing off the day&rsquo;s proceedings, Pritchard congratulated the top 1Up contenders for their efforts in going beyond the call of duty for Entelect, with the winning employee announced as Warren Bonn. In closing, Pritchard made special mention of Managing Director Shashi Hansjee, announcing that Hansjee will be taking over as CEO. Pritchard praised Hansjee saying, &ldquo;Shashi joined Entelect in 2005 as a software engineer and has had an illustrious career at Entelect since. In a short space of time he was leading big projects, was promoted to technical director and later managing director.&rdquo; Pritchard noted, &ldquo;Shashi was particularly successful in his role as MD because he is prepared to do operations and administrative work as well as set the direction for the business, and most importantly, he understands people. He has done a brilliant job in selecting and nurturing our current management team, and until recently, he made the time to see every single employee in regular performance reviews &ndash; something very few MDs of a company this size would and could do. Today, I can say with confidence that Shashi runs the ship, and will continue to run and steer the Entelect in the right direction.&rdquo; \n\nPritchard continued, &ldquo;It is for this reason that I am bidding farewell to my position as CEO and am officially handing over the reins to Shashi today! I will be staying on as chairman of the board, and of course will always be involved with Entelect and will continue to provide guidance and support to our management team.&rdquo; Pritchard closed off by announcing that his next personal mission is to help people get closer to God and to further help the poor of South Africa. He explained, &ldquo;In October last year, I was graced with a vision of Christ on the cross, which has had a profound effect on my life over the last year and literally has lit the fire in my heart to pursue this mission with God at its centre.&rdquo; He affirmed, &ldquo;I feel that the company&rsquo;s success is purely as a result of God&rsquo;s grace because of the way we conduct our business &ndash; with integrity and in true service of others, be it towards staff, clients or our extended communities &ndash; and is the reason why Entelect will continue to be successful in the future.&rdquo; \n\nHansjee thanked Pritchard for his contributions and noted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see our founder using his time and resources to do good&rdquo;. He added that this will be a seamless transition, and that Entelect&rsquo;s strong management team will continue to drive the business forward. Hansjee says that Entelect will continue developing its presence as the place to be for South Africa&rsquo;s top software talent, with further emphasis on showcasing Entelect&rsquo;s technical capability. In addressing the staff, Hansjee said, &ldquo;I am honoured and excited to continue to work with all of you to drive this great organisation towards the greatness I know we can achieve.&rdquo;&quot;}">

After presenting the internal R100K prizes and long-service awards, Entelect CEO <br />Dr Charles Pritchard outlined the year&rsquo;s highlights. <br /><br />The company&rsquo;s highlights for 2014 include: Turnover and profitability are up by 25 per cent compared with last year.<br />Staff has grown by 20 per cent to 208 employees &ndash; this figure excludes the additional 31 graduates joining in January 2015.<br />Client numbers and the size of engagements continue to grow, with the top five biggest project clients being Discovery, Liberty, Silica, FNB and Deloitte.<br />Successful launches of various internal systems that allow for more growth in the business.<br />Maturation of the existing management structures and also the addition of new management roles: data solutions and service delivery.<br />Delivery of successful projects in the newly formed Tech Accelerator initiative, with further innovations planned for 2015.<br />Entelect&rsquo;s Encentivize loyalty solution&rsquo;s numbers increased and the programme now hosts 84,000 end users, with new clients including Diners Club, Old Mutual and Deloitte. Significant growth is expected in this division for 2015.<br />Entelect&rsquo;s MyActive events solutions hosted 96 events, which is a 43 percent jump compared with last year.<br />In its annual survey Deloitte confirmed that Entelect is the best employer in Southern Africa in three categories, including the Best IT Company to Work For (all categories) &ndash; an excellent achievement considering the stature of the 160 companies that entered.<br />Entelect CTO, Martin Naude, won an award as the world&rsquo;s best loyalty practitioner.<br />Entelect featured in the press, with Entelect-related articles appearing in leading magazines and newspapers.<br />Staff seamlessly moved to new offices, which will better accomodate the company&rsquo;s increasing staff.<br />The Entelect Foundation has continued to grow, with 10 per cent of Entelect&rsquo;s profits being committed to social upliftment projects every year. Successes include putting a number of children through school, weekly mentorship by staff volunteers, issuing study scholarships, assisting families financially, running a feeding scheme for unemployed people; sponsorship of a new graphic design centre at the Frances Vorwerg school for the disabled, and donating 45 percent of the shares of Entelect's contracting company to a community development education trust.<br />The hosting of many more events by the company's social committee throughout the year, from braais and sports events to family days.<br /><br />Before closing off the day&rsquo;s proceedings, Pritchard congratulated the top 1Up contenders for their efforts in going beyond the call of duty for Entelect, with the winning employee announced as Warren Bonn. In closing, Pritchard made special mention of Managing Director Shashi Hansjee, announcing that Hansjee will be taking over as CEO. Pritchard praised Hansjee saying, &ldquo;Shashi joined Entelect in 2005 as a software engineer and has had an illustrious career at Entelect since. In a short space of time he was leading big projects, was promoted to technical director and later managing director.&rdquo; Pritchard noted, &ldquo;Shashi was particularly successful in his role as MD because he is prepared to do operations and administrative work as well as set the direction for the business, and most importantly, he understands people. He has done a brilliant job in selecting and nurturing our current management team, and until recently, he made the time to see every single employee in regular performance reviews &ndash; something very few MDs of a company this size would and could do. Today, I can say with confidence that Shashi runs the ship, and will continue to run and steer the Entelect in the right direction.&rdquo; <br /><br />Pritchard continued, &ldquo;It is for this reason that I am bidding farewell to my position as CEO and am officially handing over the reins to Shashi today! I will be staying on as chairman of the board, and of course will always be involved with Entelect and will continue to provide guidance and support to our management team.&rdquo; Pritchard closed off by announcing that his next personal mission is to help people get closer to God and to further help the poor of South Africa. He explained, &ldquo;In October last year, I was graced with a vision of Christ on the cross, which has had a profound effect on my life over the last year and literally has lit the fire in my heart to pursue this mission with God at its centre.&rdquo; He affirmed, &ldquo;I feel that the company&rsquo;s success is purely as a result of God&rsquo;s grace because of the way we conduct our business &ndash; with integrity and in true service of others, be it towards staff, clients or our extended communities &ndash; and is the reason why Entelect will continue to be successful in the future.&rdquo; <br /><br />Hansjee thanked Pritchard for his contributions and noted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see our founder using his time and resources to do good&rdquo;. He added that this will be a seamless transition, and that Entelect&rsquo;s strong management team will continue to drive the business forward. Hansjee says that Entelect will continue developing its presence as the place to be for South Africa&rsquo;s top software talent, with further emphasis on showcasing Entelect&rsquo;s technical capability. In addressing the staff, Hansjee said, &ldquo;I am honoured and excited to continue to work with all of you to drive this great organisation towards the greatness I know we can achieve.&rdquo;</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The trio of conferences started on the Sunday morning with the MVP Summit. This is Microsoft&rsquo;s annual gathering of MVPs, where the company shows off new and upcoming features of its products and elicits comments, suggestions and criticisms from the MVPs. In the case of the SQL group, there&rsquo;s often a lot of criticism! While everything discussed during the MVP summit is under NDA (which results in some amusing tweets during the conference), some of the highlights of the conference have since been announced publically and so can be discussed. These include:  Sharding for Windows Azure SQL Database (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/frcogno/archive/2014/11/04/sneak-peek-horizontal-scale-using-azure-sql-database-elastic-scale-preview-day-1.aspx)\n Updatable, non-clustered columnstore indexes, including for Hekaton tables\n Stretching tables from a physical SQL installation to Azure SQL DB (http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2014/11/06/pass-summit-keynote.aspx).\n  \nOn the Monday, Red Gate ran the Seattle leg of its SQL in the City. These mini-conferences are a mixture of technical training and marketing material and there&rsquo;s usually a good balance between the two. Tony Davis (editor for Red Gate Software) and I presented a technical session entitled &lsquo;You did WHAT to my transaction log?!?!?&rsquo; The session aimed to show just how bad things can become if people try quick solutions to log growth, without bothering to understand how the log is used and how it works.\nThe annual PASS Summit started with a bang on the Wednesday morning, but fizzled out with the boring, marketing-focused keynote that followed. One of these days we will have technical keynotes on both days, but until then&hellip; As an aside, Chris Webb&rsquo;s blog post on some of the reasons why the Wednesday keynote was badly received makes for an interesting and enlightening read.\n\nAs expected, nothing major was announced at the PASS Summit because we are halfway through a development cycle for SQL Server &ndash; no dates were given for vNext. There were some Windows Azure SQL Database announcements (unfortunately these did not include a shorter name for it), but they did include sharding and some hints as to the features that will be in vNext. These could incorporate updatable, nonclustered columnstore indexes and stretch tables to Windows Azure SQL Database.\n\nWithout much effort, the rest of Wednesday far exceeded the keynote in interest. Buck Woody discussed relevant data storage options, making the very, very important point that not everything should be shoehorned into a single solution just because that is the hammer. If part of an application&rsquo;s data persistence fits naturally into a document database and half into a graph database, that is where they should go, and they shouldn&rsquo;t both be crammed into something inappropriate.\n\nConor Cunningham, architect on the SQL team, introduced a feature for SQL Server vNext, called the Query Store. In a nutshell, Query Store is a persisted record of query performance, broken down by object and query and user-chosen interval. This feature will, in most cases, make it unnecessary to run trace/extended events sessions to capture a system&rsquo;s query workload, because it will be done continually in the background. Its best feature is that since it&rsquo;s persisted, a database backup will contain all the Query Store information with no additional work required.\n\nThursday started with a technical keynote from Dr Rimma Nehme, who works at the Microsoft Jim Gray Systems Lab. She gave an excellent technical presentation on cloud computing &mdash; for the record, she says we should blame the network people for the name &lsquo;Cloud&rsquo;. The rest of the day was just as good, with Paul Randal talking about advanced recovery options (including using hex editors on database files) and Bob Ward spending three hours talking about SQL Server IO.\n\nBy Friday, although many delegates were worn out, there was still a good-size audience for my session on the cardinality estimator. However, the later scheduling of the session could have been the reason for there being fewer questions and interaction than I would have liked. That said, all in all, the three conferences made another excellent week of technical training, friendship and learning.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:603,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/frcogno/archive/2014/11/04/sneak-peek-horizontal-scale-using-azure-sql-database-elastic-scale-preview-day-1.aspx&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:739}{&quot;1&quot;:886,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2014/11/06/pass-summit-keynote.aspx&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:965}{&quot;1&quot;:1710,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/pass-summit-2014-day-2-keynote-a-masterclass-in-cloud-databases-and-also-a-masterclass-in-tech-marketing/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1732}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;SQLSaturday is a free mini-conference run by the local SQL usergroup and as the name suggests, it is usually held on a Saturday (though there have been a couple held on a Friday). To date, there have been around 370 SQLSaturdays held on six continents and around 40 more are scheduled or in the planning phase.\n\nSQLSaturday has more than 20 sessions, ranging from DBA-centric to data analysis and cloud computing, along with a pre-con day on the Friday, which offers a full-day&rsquo;s training, though not for free. Along with a number of local and other international speakers, I&rsquo;ll be giving a presentation there. I&rsquo;ll be talking about database corruption, what should be done to ensure that a DBA is prepared if corruption strikes and what the DBA should do if a database really does become corrupt. The presentation covers backup strategies and the need for tested backups, options for consistency checks, monitoring and alerts. It also covers what a DBA should, and most importantly shouldn&rsquo;t do, should the database become corrupt.\n\nThe week following SQLSaturday Vienna is the SQL Bits conference. SQL Bits, one of the largest SQL conferences in Europe, is back in London this year with an expanded agenda. With two training days offering full-day presentations, two days of general sessions and the free Community Day on Saturday, SQL Bits has a lot to offer. SQLBits runs from 4&ndash;7 March 2015 and is held at the ExCeL London Exhibition and Convention Centre.\n\nSQLBits has grown from strength to strength over the years and it boasts a huge list of top international speakers. Some of the best-looking sessions include Itzik Ben-Gan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Boost your T-SQL with the APPLY Operator&rsquo;. Knowing Itzik, this will include some wicked-smart use of Apply that no one else had even considered. Bob Ward&rsquo;s session &lsquo;Troubleshoot the memory of SQL Server&rsquo; also promises to be enthralling. Bob is a principal escalation engineer for Microsoft&rsquo;s Customer Support, which essentially means that he fixes problems that no one else can figure out how to solve. His presentations are well known for being overloaded with information. Lastly, on the Saturday, Grant Fritchey will present &lsquo;Execution plans. What can you do with them?&rsquo; where he shows just how much information there is hiding in an execution plan.\n\nI&rsquo;m presenting two sessions this year for SQL Bits: an introductory talk on database transactions on the Thursday and a two-hour dive into indexes on the Friday. The transactions presentation is an introductory look at SQL&rsquo;s transactions. It is aimed at people fairly new to T-SQL development and aims to clear up myths and misunderstandings about what transactions do, what they don&rsquo;t do, why they should be used and when, and how they interact with isolation levels and error handling The indexing presentation is one of SQLBit&rsquo;s new double-length sessions. In it I&rsquo;ll be covering index architecture and then looking at how that architecture affects choices for the clustered index. Most of the session will be spent looking at how nonclustered indexes are used and how they should be selected to give the best possible improvement to the application performance.\n\nWith so much to look forward to and so many presentations to plan, it looks like March is going to be a busy month!&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://www.sqlsaturday.com&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:11}{&quot;1&quot;:633,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=374&amp;sessionid=27444&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:652}{&quot;1&quot;:1079,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlbits.com&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1087}{&quot;1&quot;:1638,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/Boost_your_T-SQL_with_the_APPLY_Operator&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1678}{&quot;1&quot;:1803,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/Troubleshooting_the_Memory_of_SQL_Server&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1840}{&quot;1&quot;:2167,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/Execution_Plans_What_Can_You_Do_With_Them&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:2210}{&quot;1&quot;:2368,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/On_Transactions_and_Atomic_Operations&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:2389}{&quot;1&quot;:2431,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/All_about_Indexes&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:2438}">

<div>SQLSaturday is a free mini-conference run by the local SQL usergroup and as the name suggests, it is usually held on a Saturday (though there have been a couple held on a Friday). To date, there have been around 370 SQLSaturdays held on six continents and around 40 more are scheduled or in the planning phase.<br /><br />SQLSaturday has more than 20 sessions, ranging from DBA-centric to data analysis and cloud computing, along with a pre-con day on the Friday, which offers a full-day&rsquo;s training, though not for free. Along with a number of local and other international speakers, I&rsquo;ll be giving a presentation there. I&rsquo;ll be talking about database corruption, what should be done to ensure that a DBA is prepared if corruption strikes and what the DBA should do if a database really does become corrupt. The presentation covers backup strategies and the need for tested backups, options for consistency checks, monitoring and alerts. It also covers what a DBA should, and most importantly shouldn&rsquo;t do, should the database become corrupt.<br /><br />The week following SQLSaturday Vienna is the SQL Bits conference.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The need for more tech-savvy employees, who possess the required skill sets to effectively work in dynamic, highly technical environments, has increased exponentially. &lsquo;However, while Africa offers boundless opportunities within the ICT space, there is a critical skills shortage, particularly in South Africa when compared to our counterparts across Africa,&rsquo; explains Tim Kroon, General Manager of Resourcing at Entelect. &lsquo;With a youth unemployment rate of more than one-third of young South Africans, mainly as a result of a lack of skills, we are seeing some compelling efforts from the private sector to improve ICT education levels and attract more young people to a field that provides opportunities across every business sector.&rsquo; \n\n&lsquo;Various companies and institutions have set up ICT-focussed educational funds and charities, skills development programmes and upskilling incentives,&rsquo; says Kroon. Among the most successful of these is Entelect&rsquo;s annual R100K Challenge, supported by partners Sony Mobile and NAG magazine. Now in its fourth year, the R100K Challenge hopes to encourage students to pursue a career in ICT, as well as help professional programmers to continuously learn and develop their own skills. Kroon elaborates, &lsquo;There are specific skills required to take part in a challenge such as this, which we hope will encourage more young people to improve their skills within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, with a view towards entering the ICT skills arena once their studies are complete.&rsquo; \n\nKroon goes on to explain that the R100K Challenge plays an important role in attracting people to the local development community. He says that it presents a compelling incentive to student or novice coders and professional developers alike. This year, the R100K Challenge&rsquo;s retro-gaming theme of Space Invaders is specifically designed to test the artificial intelligence (AI) skills of entrants in a face-off competition, where candidates are required to write the code for their own designed bot. &lsquo;The necessary skills to win the R100K Challenge are relevant to the industry at large. Winning requires not only the ability to write the code, but also to think strategically. Entrants will need to engage their skills of critical analysis and a structured process of testing and optimisation,&rsquo; says Kroon. As the competition grows each year, so it is modified to cater to its entrants. For example, this year the Player Portal has been launched. Here, players are able to upload their code and test it properly, offering the chance to iron out any flaws. These elements are reflective of the industry and could help prepare entrants for making the leap into the marketplace of software engineering, where professionals are primarily responsible for writing, designing and testing of computer programs. \n\nWith the global ICT industry now producing trillions of rands&rsquo; worth of value within a myriad of industries, Kroon says that it is Entelect&rsquo;s hope that the increasingly popular R100K Challenge will continue to encourage and introduce more young people to the field of programming and development, and that it will highlight the massive opportunities for them in this essential industry. &lsquo;Choosing to study within the field of ICT disciplines puts students at a great advantage when entering the marketplace, while simultaneously improving South Africa&rsquo;s capabilities and economic outlook,&rsquo; says Kroon. &lsquo;There are significant professional benefits to mastering computer programming topics, such as logic, patterns and problem solving. For students moving into computer science at tertiary level, having a background or introduction to computer programming at a high-school level will, of course, be a distinct advantage.&rsquo; \n\nThe increase in local skills will play an important role in enhancing South Africa&rsquo;s competitiveness on the global ICT stage. This will promote job creation and the opportunity for South Africa to ensure the country is able to depend on its own local products and services to meet its ICT needs, rather than outsourcing skills from other countries. It may even create the capacity for South Africa to export these skills. Kroon concludes, &lsquo;This ability will drastically improve our economic outlook in the age of the knowledge economy, and as such, we encourage other public sector organisations to take part in the drive to attract young people to our industry, through supporting existing incentives and programmes or creating their own.&rsquo;&quot;}">

They provide high-quality training run entirely by volunteers. To date, there have been more than 400 SQLSaturday events on six continents since the first one was held in Orlando in late 2007.\n This will be the fifth year in a row that there&rsquo;s a SQLSaturday held in Johannesburg. However, it&rsquo;s the first year that we have three events running in South Africa.\n \nJohannesburg is up first on 5 September. I&rsquo;m presenting several sessions there: a full day preconference session on the Friday, as well as two sessions on the Saturday. The precon is titled &lsquo;All about Execution Plans&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;ll be talking the entire day on execution plans, starting with how and why they are generated, and ending with a detailed look at the operators that can appear in the plans, what they mean and how to read them.\n \nThe first session on the Saturday, titled &lsquo;What backups?&rsquo;, covers SQL&rsquo;s backup options, the full, differential and log backups, what they each do and when they&rsquo;d be used, as well as a discussion on restore paths for different kinds of backup. The second session on the Saturday is a more advanced session called &lsquo;Lies, damned lies and statistics&rsquo;. It looks at SQL&rsquo;s statistics objects, what they are and what they are used for. It goes into detail on the part that the statistics play in the optimisation process and what can (and will) go wrong when statistics are out of date.\n  \n The second Saturday of September sees SQLSaturday moving to Cape Town. Again, I&rsquo;ll be delivering my talk on statistics.To complete the trio, on the 19 September, the very first SQLSaturday Durban will be held. In addition to the sessions on backups and statistics, I&rsquo;m also doing a two-hour presentation on execution plans. The first half is focussed on how to read execution plans and the second, on using the execution plan to identify performance problems with queries.\n \nTo end the month on a very different note, I have the pleasure of presenting an AI paper at the SAICSIT conference in Stellenbosch &hellip; a change from the usual SQL conferences indeed.&quot;}">

To date, there have been more than 400 SQLSaturday events on six continents since the first one was held in Orlando in late 2007.<br />This will be the fifth year in a row that there&rsquo;s a SQLSaturday held in Johannesburg. However, it&rsquo;s the first year that we have three events running in South Africa.<br /><br />Johannesburg is up first on 5 September. I&rsquo;m presenting several sessions there: a full day preconference session on the Friday, as well as two sessions on the Saturday. The precon is titled &lsquo;All about Execution Plans&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;ll be talking the entire day on execution plans, starting with how and why they are generated, and ending with a detailed look at the operators that can appear in the plans, what they mean and how to read them.<br /><br />The first session on the Saturday, titled &lsquo;What backups?&rsquo;, covers SQL&rsquo;s backup options, the full, differential and log backups, what they each do and when they&rsquo;d be used, as well as a discussion on restore paths for different kinds of backup. The second session on the Saturday is a more advanced session called &lsquo;Lies, damned lies and statistics&rsquo;. It looks at SQL&rsquo;s statistics objects, what they are and what they are used for. It goes into detail on the part that the statistics play in the optimisation process and what can (and will) go wrong when statistics are out of date.<br /><br />The second Saturday of September sees SQLSaturday moving to Cape Town. Again, I&rsquo;ll be delivering my talk on statistics.To complete the trio, on the 19 September, the very first SQLSaturday Durban will be held. In addition to the sessions on backups and statistics, I&rsquo;m also doing a two-hour presentation on execution plans. The first half is focussed on how to read execution plans and the second, on using the execution plan to identify performance problems with queries.<br /><br />To end the month on a very different note, I have the pleasure of presenting an AI paper at the SAICSIT conference in Stellenbosch &hellip; a change from the usual SQL conferences indeed.</div>

We need our children to be educated properly. Only 35% of children in Grade 3 are able to pass the literacy and numeracy tests for that age group. Where are the skills going to come from that we so desperately need to create jobs in SA now and in future generations?\n  \n Business has a clear role to play in improving the situation. Strategically aligned corporate social investment initiatives can go a long way towards educational upliftment in our country. The Entelect Foundation, for example, provides curriculum tutoring, life skills advice and basic support to pupils and their parents in a number of communities in Johannesburg. We spend 10% of all pre-tax profits on school fees and basic expenses such as food and transport for these kids. It might seem like a small contribution when taken in context of the country&rsquo;s dire needs, but for those families who receive the benefits, it means the world.\n  \n As the economy moves from primary and secondary-based to tertiary based, opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled workers will decrease. Many citizens aspire to a university education, seeing it as a cure-all for unemployment. But it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly evident that a back-to-basics approach is needed: a strong focus on equipping South Africans with a solid education from the ground up, particularly when it comes to literacy and numeracy.\n  \n Youth must also be encouraged to complete their schooling by providing them with a quality learning experience. As for tertiary education, youth who choose to study so-called scarce skills, like maths and science, will have the edge in the job market. To help this process, we sit on university advisory boards to help ensure that tertiary education and industry are aligned. More than 30% of our current staff base joined as graduates with no prior work experience.\n  \n Government and business need to work together to improve the employment situation. Government has the scale to reach the young and unemployed and make the long-term commitment needed to educate our children. The business community knows which skills are needed and what it takes to make someone employable.\n  \n There is a mismatch between formal-sector industry expectations and the understanding of first-time workers in terms of professionalism, specifically, timekeeping, etiquette, accountability. Many youth also believe that rising through the ranks is effortless. They are unprepared to start at the bottom and work their way up.\n  \n More businesses should also start focusing on training talented people who lack skills and experience, rather than poaching experienced employees from other companies.\n  \n However, businesses need support to do this. By improving subsidies, tax incentives, BBBEE initiatives as well as a loosening of laws that impede hiring in small businesses, the government can encourage companies to support skills development and job creation, particularly for black South Africans. There are a number of programmes that can assist with this:\n  \n &bull; Encourage businesses to provide input into the way schools are run. Using expertise gained from years in the private sector, many businesses have the capability to provide effective support structures to schools to transform their management capabilities and make a real difference.\n &bull; Campaign for people to pursue teaching careers, improve teaching salaries, while investing in improving current teachers&rsquo; skills\n &bull; Assist companies to employ and train unskilled labour in a way that makes sense for each industry\n &bull; Support entrepreneurs who create jobs for themselves and others\n  \n  \n Small business has the greatest potential for large-scale job creation.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The event was part showcase, part science show, part geek club, part maker club, offering a range of lightening talks on cutting-edge technologies as well as a variety of interactive exhibition stands where people could discover the latest creative innovations in technology.\n  \n DevDay was the brainchild of Entelect software and the first event took place in 2014. Since then it has grown well-beyond the company and into something for the broader community. This DevDay took the concept one step further and provided the South African community with a platform to showcase their innovations.\n  \n &ldquo;The initial purpose of DevDay was to give our employees an opportunity to explore aspects of the industry that they might not get exposed to in their day job, and to showcase their technology-based interests. However, the success of the event internally showed us its immense worth to the community as a whole and so we decided to open it to the public.&rdquo; Explains Sheldon Lyne, General Manger, Operations, Entelect.\n  \n The keynote speaker for the event was Uncle Bob who, in the last 40 years, has worked in various capacities on literally hundreds of software projects. In 2001, he initiated the meeting of the group that created Agile Software Development from Extreme Programming techniques and served as the first chairman of the Agile Alliance. He is also a leading member of the Worldwide Software Craftsmanship Movement, Clean Code; is a regular speaker at international conferences and trade shows; and is the founder, CEO, and president of Uncle Bob Consulting, LLC and Object Mentor Incorporated.\n  \n His presentation at DevDay was centred around the theme of encouraging Professionalism in the software industry, specifically talking on the topic of Estimations. According to Uncle Bob, the vast majority of software developers have yet to learn the practices and disciplines that constitute professional behavior. In his talk he focused on the practice of estimation and how these can be better managed by software developers.\n  \n Other speakers at DevDay 2016 included:\n &bull; Gail Shaw looking at what Big Data is, and isn&rsquo;t, and how the meaning of the term has changed over time.\n &bull; House4Hack presented on its &lsquo;Five phun projects at House4Hack using the Raspberry Pi: PiScope, 3d printing with LCARS, WifiBroadCast, FPV Cars and PiFM.\n &bull; Kristina Georgieva talking on what convolutional neural networks are, how are they used and what those in the industry could use to play around with them.\n &bull; Evan Knowles presentation was titled, &lsquo;More than one way to skin a QR&rsquo; and everything you ever wanted to know about QR.\n &bull; Philip Robinson, who went into detail about the technology used and development process of an interactive LED art installation built, from scratch, for Afrikaburn 2015. His talk included a breakdown of the design and manufacture of the custom electronics built for the installation, the construction of the artwork itself and the realities of bringing a fancy toy into the middle of the desert.\n &bull; Duncan Gillies and Nicolle Garber discussed data science techniques and approaches while using a BI and visualization tool to simplify the methodology for non-technical users. In an interesting twist he used IMBD&rsquo;s movie data set to try cluster and predict a variety of metrics.\n &bull; Dino Fizzotti whose talk was titled &ldquo;&rsquo;Blink the LED&rsquo; right?&rdquo; covered how he learnt to write software, from making hardware and developed his use his 16shades project.\n &bull; Pieter Koornhof, who, in his lightning talk, looked at why developers should consider working code in production, maintainable code, and having fun, the three most important things in their normal day-to-day.\n  \n As well as a variety of talks, there were a number of interactive exhibition stands. Both House4hack and Sterkinekor contribute to the interactive exhibition with their stands which were greatly appreciated by everyone there. Alongside this, there were LED lights, a 3D printer, a code-off, a game jam, board games and a whole bunch of other cool tech-centric and interactive stands.\n  \n &ldquo;At Entelect, we believe that communities can be a powerful place to keep learning and stay ahead of the curve. The stronger and more diverse a community network, the greater chance we engineers and developers have to remain relevant in such a fast-paced sector.&rdquo; Says Lyne.\n  \n &ldquo;As developers and leaders in the industry, we need to take ownership to drive these initiatives because we have so much knowledge to share and so many upcoming developers. There is a shortfall in good developers in South Africa but no shortage of jobs for great developers. Events like these are designed to help bridge this gap and grow the industry to its full potential.&rdquo; Concludes Lyne.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;We are still very much in the midst of the Digital Revolution. This change to the economy has pushed not only technology companies to the forefront, but also traditional-industry companies who have embraced technology. Many South Africans still do not consider a career in IT a viable option (Educating and empowering the youth), but it&rsquo;s clear that these skills will become more and more integral to the growth of our economy in the future. Who knows, in more developed economies, coding might even become as fundamental to early education as literacy and mathematics.\n So how does one spark a child&rsquo;s interest in coding? Fortunately, there are a huge number of apps and websites dedicated to this nowadays. But just leaving a child in front of a tablet or PC and hoping for the best is unlikely to inspire a real interest. Here are some tips to help them discover their potential:\n  \n 1. Emphasise the creative and fun aspects\n Some of the most satisfying elements of programming are the creative element and the instant gratification behind it. Coding taught in a monotonous academic way often misses out on those elements and results in kids becoming overwhelmed or indifferent. Most children love creating things, and love to see their creations in action &ndash; think painting or Lego. Look for tools that encourage exploration, that enable curiosity (&ldquo;I wonder what will happen if I do this?&rdquo;) and allow the child to actually see the output of what they have just done.\n For very young children, there are Apps such as Bit-by-bit or Fisher Price&rsquo;s Code-a-pillar, and for kids aged 6-10, tools like ScratchJr (web-based), Daisy the Dinosaur (iPad) and HopScotch (iPad) work really well. For slightly older children, Scratch, Lightbot and Tynker (all web-based) are great options while Lego Mindstorms bring a whole new feature to an old classic. For a comprehensive list and reviews of each option, head here: commonsensemedia\n Scratch and Tynker also bring in the gaming element, which is something many kids enjoy. Imagine the pride involved with creating their own computer game.\n  \n 2. Make it social\n Group projects can be even more rewarding, and help both the creative process and ensure that there is immediate support should a child get stuck. Look for mentors &ndash; many families will have a developer in there somewhere who will more than likely be happy to assist. Most developers understand how important coding skills are to our country&rsquo;s future. A good mentor can really make the difference between a prolonged interest and becoming overwhelmed and bored.\n Alternatively, look for local kids coding groups or hackathons. This is an area where South Africa is lacking, but there are a few out there.\n Code.org is an online platform that offers tutorials for elementary school level through to high school level. And Africa Code week offers online courses for 8-11 year olds and upwards; both are designed to teach coding skills to budding young programmers. Locally, Entelect are running a series of Schools engagement programmes, where employees take time to talk to children at schools about possible futures in coding. A number of schools are also starting to incorporate coding into their curriculum, so look out for these opportunities where available.\n  \n 3. Don&rsquo;t force things\n Every child is different. Not all kids like to paint or play sports or read, so not every child will like to code either. Exposing the child to the tools, and showing them enough support to let them make their own mind up is key. If they don&rsquo;t show immediate interest, they at least know what it&rsquo;s all about and may even revisit it at a later stage of their education.\n  \n  \n Introducing children to programming can open up paths for them in the future as these skills become integral to the growth of our economy. The skills they can learn around critical thinking, problem solving and creativity are likely to be beneficial in all sorts of walks of life. The key is to make it enjoyable. Place an emphasis on making it easy for kids to create something; allowing them see and feel the fruits of their labour, and discover their potential.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Ryan Louw, a software developer by profession, was announced as the winner of this year&rsquo;s Entelect Challenge competition, the finals of which were played out at rAge Expo on 7 October.\n  \n Louw&rsquo;s bot, &lsquo;Colonel Panic&rsquo;, built in C#, competed in all four rounds of this year&rsquo;s Challenge and stormed to first place, winning him R70,000.\n  \n Based on the hugely popular &lsquo;Battleships&rsquo; classic game, the 2017 Entelect Challenge brought together novice coders and experienced professionals as they competed against each other by coding an artificial intelligence (AI) player, or bot, to challenge other bots.\n  \n Coding and AI hobbyists and enthusiasts have spent the last six months building their bots, with the goal of winning their share of the R200,000 prize bounty.\n  \n The winning strategy\n  \n Louw&rsquo;s bot went into the finals with strong stats:\n &bull; 196 wins out of 263 matches played;\n &bull; 66,220 points won up to the final match; and\n &bull; 5 wins out of 7 clan matches played\n &ldquo;He had one of the strongest player strategies in the competition this year,&rdquo; says Tomislav Ravic, Team Lead for the Entelect Challenge.\n  \n &ldquo;Competing successfully in the Challenge is not about the best or cleanest code,&rdquo; says Ravic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design but its strategy could be highly effective. That&rsquo;s what makes the Entelect Challenge so appealing to coders of all levels.&rdquo;\n  \n Second place went to Dion van Huyssteen, who was awarded R35,000 in prize bounty. Van Huyssteen&rsquo;s bot, &lsquo;Heat Seeking bot&rsquo;, built in C++, actually went into the finals with stronger stats than Louw&rsquo;s bot: 228 wins out of 256 matches and a total of 73,310 points. But, on the day, Louw&rsquo;s strategy was stronger.\n  \n A word from the winners\n  \n This was the third time Louw competed in the Entelect Challenge. &ldquo;My first Challenge was Pacman, then Space Invaders and now Battleships. For me, the best part of the Challenge is to get into the head of your opponent. My strategy this year was helped by the tournament stages; so first, I built a basic shooting strategy, then a weapons strategy, then, in the third round, I had to work out when to use the shield.\n  \n &ldquo;I figured out that I needed to place my bots statically in strategic locations and then I needed to start shooting from the outside-in, not the inside-out, as one would normally think to do.\n  \n &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do very well in the first two rounds, so I wasn&rsquo;t even expecting to get into the finals, but was really surprised to win,&rdquo; says Louw.\n  \n Second place winner, Van Huyssteen, describes his bot strategy: &ldquo;I started with a standard heat-seeking strategy, but as the game went on, I started applying modifiers to that. The initial idea was to modify the heat maps with a bunch of variables, which I could iterate through and automate, but I ran out of time. So, I ended up with something that cleared the edges and then worked its way inwards after that.&rdquo;\n  \n Top awards all round\n  \n Third place went to Anesu Jairosi, who says this was the third time he has entered the Challenge. &ldquo;I hate losing, but I love coding so much, so I&rsquo;ve entered three times now, since Pacman. This year, my strategy was based on probability, specifically where competitors will place their ships. But then I adapted this as I realised a human player will not place their ship in the middle, so I started aiming around the edges.&rdquo;\n  \n Fourth place winner, Jaco Mostert, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every Challenge I&rsquo;ve entered; it&rsquo;s very entertaining just competing in the Challenge and having the chance to write the code. Personally, I don&rsquo;t get a chance to do any AI in my job but it&rsquo;s something I am interested in, so the Challenge allows me the opportunity to play with AI.\n  \n &ldquo;In the second battle, I focused on the side of the map, and gauged the performance and found my bot did a lot better. For the final battle, I scaled it down a bit to focus on the inside a little more but still with a good focus on the outside.&rdquo;\n  \n Sixth place went to Wynand Wolmarans, who won The Battle of Tortuga mini challenge. &ldquo;I quickly realised that a great algorithm alone will not be enough to win the Challenge this year. I spent a lot of time tweaking and adjusting my bot but the most difficult part was choosing and sticking with a strategy because it could blow up in my face at any point. The secret to success is starting with a basic strategy, testing your bot against it and then letting your imagination take over.&rdquo;\n  \n The final rankings in the 2017 competition were as follows:\n 1st Ryan Louw R70,000\n 2nd Dion van Huyssteen R35,000\n 3rd Anesu Jairosi R25,000\n 4th Jaco Mostert R25,000\n 5th Willie Theron R10,000\n 6th Wynand Wolmarans R10,000\n 7th Andre Nel R10,000\n 8th Mark-Anthony Fouche R10,000\n  \n  \n Not everyone has to be a coding wizard\n  \n This year, the competition was structured differently to allow relatively low-level coders the opportunity to enter. The team introduced four tournament battles, each one increasing the level of complexity.\n  \n &ldquo;The staggered strategy component that we introduced to the Challenge this year has been well received by the players, as it gives them a chance to refine and test their bots before entering the playoffs,&rdquo; said Ravic. The result was an increase of more than double the number of participants than last year.\n  \n &ldquo;This year, the hackathons worked really well; people were not only recruiting and challenging others, but also helping others set up their bots. Thanks to these hackathons, participants were able to collaborate and compete on a whole new level. We&rsquo;re looking forward to taking some of these concepts further next year,&rdquo; concluded Ravic.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://challenge.entelect.co.za/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:90,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://challenge.entelect.co.za/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:108}">

This approach has helped transform the LEGO brand at a time in its history when the brand was recuperating after near failure. Currently, Lars is taking the brand on another journey to reposition itself in the value chain, from block builder to much more. The 83-year-old Scandinavian company from Billund, Denmark, has survived factory fires, economic hardship during World War II, kept the company thriving through four family generations, and recovered from near bankruptcy in 2004.

Notably participation in this survey shot up to 95% which is in itself a measure of employee engagement and the value this survey holds with the company&rsquo;s employees.\n As in 2016, Entelect again recorded an engagement index way above the benchmark. This index measures an organisations overall employee engagement level in terms of work related behaviours and discretionary effort. In 2017, Entelect&rsquo;s engagement index was recorded at 80% compared to a benchmark of 68%.\n Employees are asked a series of questions pertaining to their work environments and the top scores for Entelect in 2017, voted anonymously by the employees, were:\n   The work that I do gives me a feeling or personal accomplishment\n   \n   The people I work with let me know when I&rsquo;ve done a good job\n   \n   I can identify with the values of this organisation\n   \n   This organisation makes an effort to retain the best people\n   \n Interestingly, some of the sentiments that moved into the top scores this year include:\n   This organisation makes a real effort to give public recognition for achievements\n   \n   My ideas and opinions count\n   \n   The purpose of this organisation stretches beyond profit and business success\n   \n   My manager/immediate leader values my talents and the contribution that I make\n   \n &ldquo;We&rsquo;re particularly pleased with these insights,&rdquo; explained Tomislav Ravic. &ldquo;At Entelect, we work hard to ensure our culture and brand resonates with the values of young and dynamic software engineers.

The benchmark is 34%. Typically, those categorised as Highly Engaged see a purpose in the work they do and feel that they matter to their organisation. They have high levels of pride in the work they do and are optimistic receptive and enthusiastic.\n &ldquo;This reflects the culture and heart of our organisation,&rdquo; says Ravic. &ldquo;Daily, our employees award &lsquo;Kudos&rsquo; points to each other on our internal platforms in acknowledgement of a good job well done.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Worms, this years&rsquo; Entelect Challenge (https://challenge.entelect.co.za/) launches today. The event will run from the 17th of April, and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa (@AfricaComicCon) on the 21st September at 11am on the center stage. This year it is being held at the Gallagher Convention Centre.\n  \n &ldquo;Each year we look to build the Challenge around a popular game theme, and this year is &ldquo;Worms,&rdquo; says Rishal Hurbans, Team Lead, Entelect Challenge. &ldquo;The idea behind the theme is not just to make it appealing to those of us who love gaming, but to also provide a game with simple enough rules that anyone with a basic understanding of programming can enter.&rdquo;\n  \n This year, we will again be running with a mini-playoffs series, a staggered strategy component.\n  \n The mini-playoffs series will provide more opportunities for contestants to win. As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.\n  \n There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in June, known as Early Bird Showdown and the second in July, called Modern Worm-fare, with the third one taking place in September, called Worm-ageddon. At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.\n  \n The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, for instance, the ability to introduce new weapons or cloaking devices. Thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.\n  \n This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the second time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!\n  \n As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.\n  \n &ldquo;What a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.&rdquo;\n  \n Prize money for this years&rsquo; event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place and third place will be awarded R25 000.\n  \n Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. &ldquo;We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,&rdquo; says Hurbans.\n  \n Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different.

<div>Worms, this years&rsquo; Entelect Challenge (https://challenge.entelect.co.za/) launches today. The event will run from the 17th of April, and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa (@AfricaComicCon) on the 21st September at 11am on the center stage. This year it is being held at the Gallagher Convention Centre.<br /><br />&ldquo;Each year we look to build the Challenge around a popular game theme, and this year is &ldquo;Worms,&rdquo; says Rishal Hurbans, Team Lead, Entelect Challenge. &ldquo;The idea behind the theme is not just to make it appealing to those of us who love gaming, but to also provide a game with simple enough rules that anyone with a basic understanding of programming can enter.&rdquo;<br /><br />This year, we will again be running with a mini-playoffs series, a staggered strategy component.<br /><br />The mini-playoffs series will provide more opportunities for contestants to win. As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.<br /><br />There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in June, known as Early Bird Showdown and the second in July, called Modern Worm-fare, with the third one taking place in September, called Worm-ageddon. At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.<br /><br />The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, for instance, the ability to introduce new weapons or cloaking devices. Thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.<br /><br />This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the second time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!<br /><br />As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.<br /><br />&ldquo;What a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.&rdquo;<br /><br />Prize money for this years&rsquo; event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place and third place will be awarded R25 000.<br /><br />Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. &ldquo;We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,&rdquo; says Hurbans.<br /><br />Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different. Machine learning is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed by focusing on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. By comparison, AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.<br /><br />While AI is seeing an exciting growth, Machine Learning is all around us and changing the way we live and work. There is no doubt that jobs of the future will rely on Machine Learning to a greater or lesser extent.<br /><br />The Entelect challenge shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as something that only super coding geeks can enter.

Who could win is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Overdrive, this years&rsquo; Entelect Challenge (https://challenge.entelect.co.za/) launches today. The event will run from the 19th of March, and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa (@AfricaComicCon) on the 26th September at 11am on the center stage. This year it is again being held at the Gallagher Convention Centre.\n  \n &ldquo;Each year we look to build the Challenge around a popular game theme, and this year is &ldquo;Overdrive,&rdquo; says Bianca McFadyen, Marketing Manager, Entelect. &ldquo;The idea behind the theme is not just to make it appealing to those of us who love gaming, but to also provide a game with simple enough rules that anyone with a basic understanding of programming can enter.&rdquo;\n  \n This year, we will be running with a mini-playoffs series, a staggered strategy component.\n  \n The mini-playoffs series will provide more opportunities for contestants to win. As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.\n  \n There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in May, known as Box Carting and the second in June, called The Furious and the Fast 42, with the third one taking place in August, called Vrrrpa! Wanna dice chaana? At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.\n  \n The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.\n  \n This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the third time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!\n  \n As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.\n  \n &ldquo;What a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.&rdquo;\n  \n Prize money for this years&rsquo; event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place, third and fourth place will be awarded R25 000 and 5th place is R10 000.\n  \n Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. &ldquo;We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,&rdquo; says McFadyen.\n  \n Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different. Machine learning is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed by focusing on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. By comparison, AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.\n  \n While AI is seeing an exciting growth, Machine Learning is all around us and changing the way we live and work. There is no doubt that jobs of the future will rely on Machine Learning to a greater or lesser extent.\n  \n The Entelect challenge shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as something that only super coding geeks can enter. This competition is designed for anyone with a basic level of programming who is interested in the world of machine learning and the future of software.\n  \n This year we expect a wide variety of people from different backgrounds to enter which is going to make the player strategies really exciting. Who could win is anyone&rsquo;s guess?\n  \n https://challenge.entelect.co.za/\n https://forum.entelect.co.za/c/entelect-challenge-2020\n https://culture.entelect.co.za/&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:43,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://challenge.entelect.co.za/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:76}{&quot;1&quot;:4222,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://challenge.entelect.co.za/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4255}{&quot;1&quot;:4257,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://challenge.entelect.co.za/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4311}{&quot;1&quot;:4313,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://challenge.entelect.co.za/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4344}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Graduate applications are open for 2021\n After a challenging two months, our current 64 graduates made it through Entelect&rsquo;s 2020 Boot Camp. This programme has been running at Entelect for several years and was developed to escalate all our graduates&rsquo; technical careers. If you are interested in joining Entelect&rsquo;s 2021 Graduate Programme and being part of our Boot Camp visit https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now\n What happens before our Boot Camp kicks off?\nThe most anticipated initiative of the Entelect Graduate Programme are the highly successful open days for upcoming university graduates, held at our offices in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg and Century City, Cape Town. Our Open Days are by invite only and are open to graduates we have either met and communicated with at Career Days, or who have reached out to us, by applying for graduate roles via https://culture.entelect.co.za/position/graduate/ and who have met our minimum requirements. The main objective of our Open Days is for students to gain a better understanding of the software industry, our company and to get better insights and advice on how to enter the job market. The Entelect leadership and management teams attend every Open Day and students get a chance to meet and ask questions from our CEO, Delivery Managers, Account Managers, Solution Architects and previous graduates.\n\nBecause of the overwhelming response from students all over the country to attend these Open Days, this year, we have taken the stance of having these days more often and we hope to kick off the first remote Open Day soon. Our graduate intake for 2021 promises to be very strong and due to our Vacation Work Programme we have already offered several graduates roles for next year.\n \nWhat is the Entelect Graduate Boot Camp programme?\nEach year, we appoint some of the top BSc Computer Science, Engineering and BCom Information Systems graduates from all mainstream universities around the country for our graduate Boot Camp. These graduates start out as full-time Entelect employees, but first complete two months of training and upskilling during our Boot Camp. After completing the Boot Camp programme, the graduates get to work on client or internal projects under the mentorship of our team and technical leads.\n Our clients benefit as they get to work with the country&rsquo;s top graduates who have escalated their technical careers through the programme, while our seniors also benefit personally from helping or people in the specialist areas that they are most passionate about.\n  \n Boot Camp covers both the practical and theoretical side of end-to-end technology solutions. All graduates work through this full syllabus, regardless of which solutions stream they will be working on, giving them a rounded understanding of the full software development lifecycle. By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they will have collaborated to write components of systems in various languages and platforms, all of which would have been vetted and code-reviewed by various technical leads.\n \nWhy do we run this programme?\nEntelect&rsquo;s client base are among the best blue-chip corporates in South Africa. Their appetite for the development of big bespoke systems that differentiate them in the marketplace keeps climbing, hence the demand for talented software engineers. Our extensive training and mentorship programmes are a real differentiator for Entelectuals. Our culture of continuous learning and growing our people is something that is instilled throughout the company.\n\nThere is still a severe shortage of high-end software engineering skills in South Africa. This is why we believe investing in quality software engineering training programmes is a global priority.\n \nWhen building software, engineers need to consider issues such as maintainability, quality, stability, performance, consistent standards, security, and scalability. To build a perfect solution requires the engineer to do all these things in parallel, which is true craftsmanship and takes years of experience. It requires significant thought to be applied to the architecture and design, the ability to apply computer science principles and a strong problem-solving ability. As such, mastering the skills required to deliver great software is a highly adapted talent.\n\nThe Entelect Graduate Boot Camp Programme was created to help build great software engineers, who can solve the toughest problems, deliver quality software using best practises, and who are supported by our other 650 top engineers all over the world.\n\n\n Apply Now&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:377,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:417}{&quot;1&quot;:863,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/position/graduate/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:912}{&quot;1&quot;:4575,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:4584}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;It all starts with a vision. Often business-as-usual includes putting out fires, making sure the small things are happening, and meeting short-term targets. For an organisation to truly be disruptive, it needs an overarching vision of where it wants to be &ndash; no matter how ambitious it might be. Without an ambitious vision, organisations tend to wither away over time. Let&rsquo;s explore the facets that can guide defining a vision.\n  \n 01. WE ARE ALL PEOPLE, WE ARE ALL USERS\n \nAs users, we all know what it feels like to get frustrated with technology, but we also know the immense joy and empowerment it can bring to our lives when a solution is done right. We have apps on our phone that we simply cannot live without, other apps that are deleted within 3 seconds of downloading, and apps that are simply relegated to the app graveyard.\n  \n As people, we don&rsquo;t care about features, we care about accomplishing a goal. It might be communicating with loved ones, managing finances, or sharing your memories. The technical bits that make these things happen mean nothing.\n  \n The key to the success of a digital solution is adoption by users and that can only be enabled through empathy for all involved, using robust qualitative research (research that&rsquo;s more opinion) and quantitative research (research that&rsquo;s more empirical).\n  \n  \n 02. HOW IDEAS ARE SHAPED\n \nThe life of a solution begins with an idea; the business recognises a challenge and feels it may be solved through technology. Business stakeholders may already have a clear idea of what form the solution should take, what type of tech to use and what the eventual outcome may look like. The important factors often forgotten are seeing the solution as a vehicle for strategic innovation by empathising with the people actually involved in the trenches and being open-minded about who the customers are, what their goals are, and how these ideas can address those issues while providing business value.\n  \n 03. THE ROLE OF UX ENGINEERING: UNDERSTANDING\n \nUX engineering means to be involved with business and technical stakeholders from the very beginning to understand the potential constraints and opportunities for any potential solution. This can take many forms, such as stakeholder interviews or focus groups, heuristic evaluation (expert assessments of existing systems) and analysis of existing user data, and business or technical processes. This will allow the construction of a broad framework to direct research and design goals. Without this step, the solution is at risk of being designed solely for the assumed requirements and not the ecosystem in which the solution must live.\n  \n While a thorough understanding of the business and technology is vital, it should not affect the necessary objectivity or empathy required when engaging with the users or potential users of the solution. To retain objectivity and guide a user-centred design approach, we must employ rigorous research methods ranging from large quantitative data-gathering to smaller, more targeted qualitative exercises. The type of research methods selected are as important as the research itself and the project should have a strategic UX plan to guide that process. The next diagram shows where different research approaches fit within the UX research landscape.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n There are many considerations when choosing which research method to use and the following should be considered at the start of every project:\n \n&bull; What is this research method typically used for?\n&bull; What will implementing this method cost?\n&bull; How difficult will it be to collect the data?\n&bull; How difficult will it be to analyse the data?\n&bull; What type of research category does this fall into?\n&bull; What is the context of use of the method?\n  \n  \n In addition to classic UX research methods, there are many new ways in which UX engineers engage with both stakeholders and users. One that has gained traction over recent years is Design Sprints. Design Sprints were created to condense and target various UX methods such as stakeholder engagement and user testing into a fast and furious 5 days. More on this coming up.\n  \n 04. THE ROLE OF UX ENGINEERING: INTERPRETING AND EXTERNALISING\n \nThe activities and artefacts generated through UX engineering include valuable information from different dimensions of the business and project. These finding are invaluable references for making critical decisions about features and direction.\n \n&bull; Contextual inquiries: Data-gathering technique combing observational research and semi-structured interviews in the user&rsquo;s context of use\n&bull; One on one interviews and/or focus group transcripts and analysis\n&bull; Thematic analysis: Ways to organise research gathered, such as interviews or observations into useful and consistent themes\n&bull; Personas: Consolidating research on users into imagined users to represent a larger set of data\n&bull; User journeys: Mapping the entire journey that a user/customer takes during their use of a product or service, which aids in understanding sentiment, needs and goals\n  \n 05. DESIGN SPRINT: PARTICIPATORY DESIGN\n  \n  \n A Design Sprint is an excellent tool in the case where the business needs to be involved in ideation. As mentioned previously, this is a 5-day design process including all those that will be involved in making the project a success. Prior to beginning the sprint, those involved must have consumed the research gathered in the previous phase of the design lifecycle and now have solid grasp of their users.\n  \n  \n Day One\nWe define our goals both for the business and the users. We then define the actors involved in the business problem and then map their journey towards the defined goals. We will also come up with questions and ideas through a process called \&quot;How Might We\&quot; (HMW). This involves crowd sourcing thoughts in a structured way to provide detailed context about a process. Additionally, it highlights areas of interest through a voting process.\n  \n Day Two\nWe&rsquo;ll begin sketching out possible solutions to the problem. There are many methods we use to encourage creativity and allow stakeholders to explore their ability to ideate, free of constraints. We will then display the works, present them and vote on them.\n \nDay Three\nWe&rsquo;ll do the final round of voting and then begin storyboarding the solution using the best parts of each idea or sketch. As you can see, we start with individuals working collectively to form individual ideas, that are then voted on and consolidated into a single vision &ndash; this is why the eventual storyboard is so powerful.\n  \n Day Four\nOn the fourth day, our design team prototypes the solution. The other stakeholders may be involved if they so desire or if it is necessary to the goal, but it is often just the design team that manages this part of the process. We design a working prototype to test with real users the next day.\n  \n Day Five\nOn the fifth day, we venture out into real-world operations where the solution may be used. User testing is conducted and provides an opportunity to learn and validate solutions. This gives us crucial insights into the viability of a solution or part of a solution which can then be reported back to the stakeholders. In this way, we can know what works and what doesn&rsquo;t with little time wasted if the idea fails and much gained if it is a success.\n  \n Prototyping and testing are however more involved processes for the solution as a whole. So, while the Design Sprint offers a way to tackle innovation and collaboration on specific areas of a solution, dedicated and extensive prototyping and testing is still required.\n  \n 06. TEST AND REFINE\n \nThe power of the prototype is that one can create a testable design in significantly less time than it takes to develop a solution in code. According to Dr Susan Weinschenk in her paper Usability: A Business Case, 50% of development time can be saved by doing UX research upfront. Testing can take many forms, much like the user research mentioned above. Some of the same techniques we saw in the user research phase can and will be repeated here, for example:\n  \n  \n  \n  \n &bull; Usability-lab studies: Controlled and observed test of users, using your prototype.\n&bull; Eye tracking: Users eye movements are tracked while using a prototype, to understand focus areas and how to optimise the design.\n&bull; A/B testing: Testing variations of your prototype or elements of it, to see which designs users favour.\n  \n  \n  \n Based on the testing done on the prototypes, the UX engineer can continue to refine the designs until they have been optimised. The reporting done during the prototype testing is again hugely valuable for the understanding of all stakeholders as to why certain design decisions have been taken. In fact, it is ideal if the product owner and team attend some of the user tests, as this engenders empathy and understanding directly.\n  \n 07. THE RECURSIVE VALUE OF UX\n \nIf a UX engineer is included in the process, it will have continuous value to all those involved in the project later down the line. The result should be a set of validated and tested prototypes that consolidate all stakeholders needs into a design vision. It should also enable decision makers, architects, developers and analysts to add value to the solution in new and innovative ways, driven by a robust body of research.\n  \n Read the full From Here to There publication here.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:9362,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:9367}">

As mentioned previously, this is a 5-day design process including all those that will be involved in making the project a success. Prior to beginning the sprint, those involved must have consumed the research gathered in the previous phase of the design lifecycle and now have solid grasp of their users.<br /><br /><br />Day One<br />We define our goals both for the business and the users. We then define the actors involved in the business problem and then map their journey towards the defined goals. We will also come up with questions and ideas through a process called "How Might We" (HMW). This involves crowd sourcing thoughts in a structured way to provide detailed context about a process. Additionally, it highlights areas of interest through a voting process.<br /><br />Day Two<br />We&rsquo;ll begin sketching out possible solutions to the problem. There are many methods we use to encourage creativity and allow stakeholders to explore their ability to ideate, free of constraints. We will then display the works, present them and vote on them.<br /><br />Day Three<br />We&rsquo;ll do the final round of voting and then begin storyboarding the solution using the best parts of each idea or sketch. As you can see, we start with individuals working collectively to form individual ideas, that are then voted on and consolidated into a single vision &ndash; this is why the eventual storyboard is so powerful.<br /><br />Day Four<br />On the fourth day, our design team prototypes the solution. The other stakeholders may be involved if they so desire or if it is necessary to the goal, but it is often just the design team that manages this part of the process. We design a working prototype to test with real users the next day.<br /><br />Day Five<br />On the fifth day, we venture out into real-world operations where the solution may be used. User testing is conducted and provides an opportunity to learn and validate solutions. This gives us crucial insights into the viability of a solution or part of a solution which can then be reported back to the stakeholders. In this way, we can know what works and what doesn&rsquo;t with little time wasted if the idea fails and much gained if it is a success.<br /><br />Prototyping and testing are however more involved processes for the solution as a whole. So, while the Design Sprint offers a way to tackle innovation and collaboration on specific areas of a solution, dedicated and extensive prototyping and testing is still required.<br /><br />06. TEST AND REFINE<br /><br />The power of the prototype is that one can create a testable design in significantly less time than it takes to develop a solution in code. According to Dr Susan Weinschenk in her paper Usability: A Business Case, 50% of development time can be saved by doing UX research upfront. Testing can take many forms, much like the user research mentioned above. Some of the same techniques we saw in the user research phase can and will be repeated here, for example:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&bull; Usability-lab studies: Controlled and observed test of users, using your prototype.<br />&bull; Eye tracking: Users eye movements are tracked while using a prototype, to understand focus areas and how to optimise the design.<br />&bull; A/B testing: Testing variations of your prototype or elements of it, to see which designs users favour.<br /><br /><br /><br />Based on the testing done on the prototypes, the UX engineer can continue to refine the designs until they have been optimised. The reporting done during the prototype testing is again hugely valuable for the understanding of all stakeholders as to why certain design decisions have been taken. In fact, it is ideal if the product owner and team attend some of the user tests, as this engenders empathy and understanding directly.<br /><br />07. THE RECURSIVE VALUE OF UX<br /><br />If a UX engineer is included in the process, it will have continuous value to all those involved in the project later down the line. The result should be a set of validated and tested prototypes that consolidate all stakeholders needs into a design vision. It should also enable decision makers, architects, developers and analysts to add value to the solution in new and innovative ways, driven by a robust body of research.<br /><br />Read the full From </a><a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here </a>to There publication here.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As outlined in the previous chapter, the life of a disruptive solution in an established enterprise should always start with a vision. The vision for where an organisation wants to be, what it looks like, and what it offers in future is where innovation happens, as opposed to putting out fires and only addressing the problems that exist now. The business aspect in the lifecycle is critical to the success of the solution. Ultimately, the solution is simply a tool to facilitate the ambitions of the business and possibly differentiate from competitors. This chapter looks at the important facets in a successful solution regarding alignment, evaluating value, mitigating risk, assigning accountability, and understanding the operations of the business.\n  \n  \n 01. Alignment: Stakeholder buy-in and alignment\n After the process of exploring and defining a vision - which stakeholders from different areas in the business should be part of - a consensus must be agreed upon by the stakeholders. Key decision-makers, including executives, managers, and operations, must have an understanding of exactly what is trying to be achieved and how it will impact their respective areas. The proposed solution should be well understood and in alignment with existing initiatives and tactics, or at very least, not directly hinder them.\n\nInnovative solutions usually challenge the status quo which causes uneasiness among stakeholders, and challenges the existing tried and trusted ways of doing things. However, if the need for change is embraced, driven top-down and transparent, then the energy and willingness of teams are boosted, which usually reduces friction.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 02. Value: Data-driven decisions\n \nIt tends to be easy to make decisions based on gut-feel and push your ideas because, well, they&rsquo;re your ideas &ndash; you want to add value and be recognised for doing so. But this becomes dangerous when an idea, or at least the core mechanics of the idea, have not been validated.\n  \n It can&rsquo;t be disputed that people with years of experience in an industry or business understand underlying trends and invisible consequences of actions, but that intuition is based on the past. Businesses have thrived via traditional models while making small tweaks to react to the market and demands of the consumer. But rapid advances in technology require one to take a step back, and apply knowledge and experience while taking some risk in trying something unheard of.\n  \n This risk can be mitigated by making decisions based on data. By utilising data from sales, retention, behaviour and usage, operations, and the respective costs for those areas, decisions can be based on facts rather than a hunch. Analysing competitor performance where they have adopted similar approaches is also useful in validating the viability of a solution. Although these techniques do not eliminate risk completely, they provide guidance and informs decisions going forward.\n  \n  \n 03. Cost vs value\n \nOne of the primary considerations for embarking on an innovation project is the cost versus value to execute. What is the return on investment? When will it start making a difference? As with anything, a return on investment, especially a big one, is not guaranteed. However, there are different approaches to consider that can reduce costs, and ease sceptical minds. These approaches include design sprints where ideas are fleshed out, prototyped, tested, and reported on during the week before a large project is undertaken.\n  \n Another approach is minimum viable product (MVP) based development. The controversy &ndash; MVP is often misunderstood as &ldquo;what we have plus these things&rdquo;. An MVP should simply contain the &ldquo;what we have&rdquo;, or the &ldquo;plus these things&rdquo;, or do something different. Migrating existing features to a new technology is not an &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; project; it is good practice if a legacy system is no longer viable. Sure, this might enable future innovation, but we&rsquo;re talking about truly doing something differentiating.\n  \n The most successful approach is to embrace change and accept failure. To accomplish this, you commission a team to work on the new project, but priorities are decided on at each sprint, or each month. If they need improvement, great &ndash; iterate. If they don&rsquo;t work, throw them away. If the entire idea is doomed, disassemble the team. The cost of running a team on a month-to-month basis while testing ideas and reacting to them is always cheaper than commissioning a team for a long period of time, with a constrained specification and no room to adapt to the ever-changing business and technology landscape. Every cost that yields learning is valuable &ndash; the trick is to strike a balance. Cost of learning must be accepted, however, learning and never leveraging it for business value can be detrimental.\n  \n 04. Risk: Change management and service design\n \nApart from the cost of development, the biggest risks in these projects are more related to change management or service design. The individuals in the organisation have learnt the lay of the land, and it is human nature to resist change.\n  \n The management of training, education, and roll-out with everyone on the same page is a difficult feat if not enough attention is paid to it. This is true for customers as well. Organisations often change their offerings and receive backlash from customers even though the new solution is objectively better &ndash; humans don&rsquo;t like change. Strategic thinking and a pragmatic approach are needed.\n  \n  \n  \n 05. Risk: Consistency over big bang\n \nAnother risk is in setting immovable deadlines for releases of big chunks of the solution. This usually ends in a sub-par experience, poor technical quality, or unmet expectations.\n An approach to mitigate this is to release smaller iterations faster, test the behaviour and impact, refine, and repeat for every aspect of the solution.\n In implementation, this can make expectations difficult to manage &ndash; but if it was easy, everyone would be a world-class, bleeding edge enterprise. More often than not, consistency is more sustainable and successful in the long run over big bang releases.\n  \n  \n  \n 06. Accountability: Decision making\n \nAlthough there should be buy-in and alignment among a variety of stakeholders, there must be an individual owner and decider. This person should have the strategic insight of the organisation, have autonomy in making critical decisions, and influence change. This individual must lean on others for different insights and direction, but ultimately, projects that rely on many people for approvals typically create blockers, lose momentum, and drain energy due to bureaucracy. Making decisions as a committee is almost always nuanced causing long wait times or poor outcomes due to a single individual not being invested and held accountable.\n \n\nThe decision-maker must be available and decisive. Do you need to allocate office space for this special project? This person should be able to make the call. Need to provision an account for a specific technology or platform? This person should be able to make the call. This individual is ultimately responsible and accountable for the solution and people involved in making it happen. Furthermore, the individuals that comprise the team should have autonomy and use their discretion for micro decisions that need to be made on a daily and hourly basis. By embracing this, measuring solution performance, and being open to iterate and fail, magic happens.\n  \n 07. Priority and communication\n \nFriction in priority and communication are common themes in innovation projects. Everyone is excited and looking for how they can leverage the initiative. Having a single solution provide direct value to multiple stakeholders in different departments within the organisation can be problematic. It is obvious that each stakeholder will look out for their own department first and negotiate for their priorities. A strong owner must be able to understand the needs of the different stakeholders, prioritise, and communicate what will happen, when it will happen, and why that decision is preferable.\n  \n 08. Business Analysis: Understand operations at all levels\n \nIt is important to understand the operations of the business from all levels. For example, what are the economies within the business, what is the average customer acquisition cost, what is the process followed in branches, what daily planning happens for different teams. A general understanding of these facets reveals hidden mechanisms which mould the solution, helps address problems before they happen, and creates champions for progression in the employee structure if they are involved and heard from the beginning.\n \n\nAfter looking at the processes that exist in the business, hidden business rules, exception cases, and ways to handle them emerge. This understanding allows for consolidation of business rules, simplification, and leaner operations. These rules will also be changed and/or developed into the new solution being developed. With more unknowns comes more complexity, cases to cater for, and uncertainty.\n \n\nAlthough embracing iterative development, failure, and learning is good, this does not negate the need for a concise and understandable functional specification. This could be a document, but more preferably, user stories that both business and technology teams can understand. The use of collaborative tools to track stories and share details about them is invaluable to productivity. These can manifest in story boards, wikis, and other tools that improve the productivity of everyone &ndash; do what works for the people.\n  \n  \n  \n 09. IT and technology\n \nThere is a chapter about technology later, but at this point in the journey, it is critical to involve and build rapport with the existing IT teams. Generally, IT divisions have been a function within the company that took care of the infrastructure to enable individuals within the organisation. This included overarching concerns such as provisioning of computers, managing networks, managing software licences, and sometimes developing solutions.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n In this day and age, IT is part of almost every business function. IT skills and decision makers are mandated to build and maintain technology. For this to be successful, business and technology must work together and cannot be separated concerns anymore. Involving IT teams in at the beginning creates ownership, buy-in, and energy to work together rather than receiving tasks with little context over a wall. Understanding the existing IT landscape is useful in planning ahead. Existing adopted technology should not stifle the technology decisions for the solution, but planning for how it can be incorporated as seamlessly as possible is a real need which is better embarked on earlier rather than later.\n  \n Ultimately, the success of any solution, whether it involves technology or not, is centred around people. We need to facilitate communication and alignment in understanding, mitigate risk, forecast value, and learn from what we do. With these fundamental principles, solving hard problems becomes easier.\n  \n \nRead the full From Here to There publication here.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:11213,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:11217}">

This could be a document, but more preferably, user stories that both business and technology teams can understand. The use of collaborative tools to track stories and share details about them is invaluable to productivity. These can manifest in story boards, wikis, and other tools that improve the productivity of everyone &ndash; do what works for the people.<br /><br /><br /><br />09. IT and technology<br /><br />There is a chapter about technology later, but at this point in the journey, it is critical to involve and build rapport with the existing IT teams. Generally, IT divisions have been a function within the company that took care of the infrastructure to enable individuals within the organisation. This included overarching concerns such as provisioning of computers, managing networks, managing software licences, and sometimes developing solutions.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In this day and age, IT is part of almost every business function. IT skills and decision makers are mandated to build and maintain technology. For this to be successful, business and technology must work together and cannot be separated concerns anymore. Involving IT teams in at the beginning creates ownership, buy-in, and energy to work together rather than receiving tasks with little context over a wall. Understanding the existing IT landscape is useful in planning ahead. Existing adopted technology should not stifle the technology decisions for the solution, but planning for how it can be incorporated as seamlessly as possible is a real need which is better embarked on earlier rather than later.<br /><br />Ultimately, the success of any solution, whether it involves technology or not, is centred around people. We need to facilitate communication and alignment in understanding, mitigate risk, forecast value, and learn from what we do. With these fundamental principles, solving hard problems becomes easier.<br /><br /><br />Read the full From Here to There publication </a><a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>

The chosen process should help teams to deliver a quality solution or product within a predictable timeline and at a sustainable pace. In software, this process is called the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) which has process elements including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance. Various nuances of these process elements exist and are applied differently depending on the environment the team find themselves in.\n  \n  \n 01. Agile means being adaptable\n \nSoftware teams struggle when the principles and values of the chosen process are rooted in traditional manufacturing and engineering disciplines. The software engineering profession is fundamentally different in several ways which causes traditional processes to fail.\n  \n Traditional planning is centred around predictable tasks or activities with known manufacturing times while software projects usually start with an end goal and the tasks or activities are discovered and figured out along the way.\n  \n Progress is not linear to time because in problem solving, people generally start to work faster as soon as the problem is solved. In traditional manufacturing, the throughput rate is usually consistent and linear to time.\n  \n In the following sections we will look at some key considerations for implementing a successful software development process. Whether your organisation calls it Agile, Waterfall or any hybrid SDLC in between those two extremes, we advocate to focus on getting four key considerations right for the development process. They are called considerations because this gives organisations the freedom to make it work in their context instead of feeling like they are failing because they do not follow the Agile or Waterfall textbook.\n  \n 02. Software Development Lifecycles\n \nThe first consideration is demystifying the noise around the SDLC and whether teams are following an Agile approach. The reality is that Agile is not a process, but rather a set of values and principles that a team lives and applies daily. This gives the team the freedom to follow any process or methodology they like while pursuing continuous improvement in iterative cycles.\n  \n The Agile manifesto proposes the following values for an adaptive team and development lifecycle:\n \n&bull; Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n \n&bull; Working software over comprehensive documentation\n \n&bull; Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n \n&bull; Responding to change over following a plan\n  \n That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\n  \n If we evaluate the manifesto from a process point of view, it is clear that whatever methodology you choose, make sure you have regular interactions with all stakeholders in the project. The process should make time in everyone&rsquo;s calendars to talk and discuss the project. The goal is to have effective conversations about the project on a regular basis and we have found that co-location and face-to-face discussions is the preferred approach. The best alternative to co-location and face-to-face discussions is to have video conferencing combined with an instant messaging platform geared towards group discussions. When working with a distributed team, the most effective approach is when everyone is remote. A co-located group with a minority of individuals remoting in tends to treat the remote members as second-class citizens.\n  \n The process must enable the delivery of working software instead of creating documents which do not solve business problems. Documentation must have an audience and only describe concepts which do not often change, e.g. project vision and purpose, logical system architecture, and business rules and key decisions made during the project that have a significant impact. Specifying features in detail will often not be accurate and maintaining the documentation becomes cumbersome and adds little value.\n  \n Economic factors will play a role in customer collaboration, and so contract negotiation cannot be ignored. Projects do not have unlimited budgets and need to be delivered within the economic constraints of the business. The principle here is that if customers are part of the development process, then the solution or project will evolve and change with the team. The scope negotiated at the start of the project should not be enforced to the letter if the final delivered solution still solves the business problem, which is typically not the same as originally envisaged at inception. Being clear on the project vision and purpose at the start of the journey will aid the team to make decisions as the project evolves and test their decisions against this vision and purpose.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n Regular planning sessions enable the team to respond to change rather than creating a plan up front and sticking to it no matter what. Different levels of planning from a high-level flight plan, to a sprint plan broken down into tasks all contribute to keeping the team focussed on what must happen next while keeping an eye on the overall project progress. Scope creep or changes in direction need to be embraced but must be done in a responsible way. Changes in planning should be done between iterations to keep the team focussed during the iteration. Having a high-level flight plan coupled with a detailed sprint plan helps the team to determine the impact of scope changes to the overall project scope. The stakeholders must be involved in the planning sessions to make decisions if plans need to be adjusted.\n  \n 3. Cross-functional teams\n \nOther considerations for software development processes include skills and capability, prioritisation, and participation and transparency.\n \nAny process is only as good as the people who execute it, and making sure that a team of individuals have the right skill combinations for the problem space, is how we build self-organising teams. This requires people to have analysis, development, testing, data and project management skills within the team. It does not mean that one person is responsible for each of these disciplines but rather the team needs these skills spread across individuals.\n  \n Large organisations tend to employ people to fulfil a specific responsibility in the SDLC, e.g. only do analysis, development, testing or project management. This approach will inevitably lead to silos and bottle necks within the organisation, coupled with a large management overhead.\n  \n The size of a team is also a factor which is considered. Having two teams of 5 is usually more effective than having one team of 10. Quality practices like pull requests, code reviews and interpersonal communication are all affected by the size of a team. A truly self-organising team requires a high level of awareness within the team and this becomes challenging in a large team.\n  \n Prioritisation and clarity, or a shared understanding of what needs to be built, is the cornerstone of effective software teams. A self-organising team is about trusting the team to figure out how to solve a problem. It is not about letting the team figure out business priority and what needs to be solved.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Software plays a role in almost every part of every business. Technical teams are responsible for understanding the digital landscape within the organisation and outside of it. This includes selecting the most sensible tools and frameworks to solve problems, and designing software using best practices to enable maintainable solutions that can evolve going forward.\n  \n In order to make system design decisions, some level of understanding is needed of what the envisioned functional and non-functional requirements are. The following questions need to be answered:\n \n&bull; What is the problem we are trying to solve? \n&bull; Who/what will use it? \n&bull; What does the existing technology landscape look like and what integrations are needed? \n&bull; How must it scale and perform? \n&bull; Who is going to develop and maintain it? \n&bull; What technical skills are available?\n  \n Taking the answers to these questions into account, we will be able to make critical decisions like:\n \n&bull; Where the solution will be deployed and hosted?\n&bull; Which technologies will be used to build the solution?\n&bull; What the plan is for scaling up under load?\n&bull; What security measures are needed?\n&bull; How does the solution fit into the greater technology ecosystem?\n  \n There are several technology and deployment stacks available today, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. There are differences to what each technology is good at and the ease with which they can be used to implement different types of solutions, but often the deciding factor is what skills are available in the team who is to develop and maintain it and where the team is going strategically. As new technologies come out frequently one does want to be a little conservative: one should make sure any proposed technology has a proven track record with regards to scalability and maintainability.\n  \n 1. Architecture\nWhen designing a solution there are many technical architecture considerations known as non-functional requirements that need to be considered. Even if most of these requirements are not implemented at the start, it is essential to keep them in mind from the beginning and have a clear understanding of how provision will be made when the time comes to cater for them. This is needed because these types of requirements typically take much more effort to implement later in the life of the solution if no consideration was given to them early on. Some examples are mentioned on the next page.\n  \n &bull; Scalability\nThis is how system resources are added to handle a growing amount of work, e.g. adding memory to the database host or adding another node on a cluster. Some applications (especially legacy applications) can only be scaled vertically. This means more resources like memory or CPU power must be added to a single server in order to get better performance. However this has physical limits, and costs increase faster than the improvement in performance. It is preferable for an application to allow horizontal scaling to allow adding more average powered nodes to a cluster for better performance. This is typically more cost-effective and has many secondary benefits, such as better availability and reliability.\n  \n &bull; Throughput\nThe rate at which the system must be able to handle requests, e.g. the number of transactions per second the system must cater for.\n  \n &bull; Performance\nThe amount of useful work accomplished by the system with a given amount of resources, e.g. having a low response time or low resource utilisation.\n  \n &bull; Volumes\nHow much data the system must be able to handle, e.g. storing two million records per year or handle 1MB file imports.\n  \n &bull; Security\nThe resilience the system has against potential harm, unwanted changes and data leaks. No system is 100% secure. The key business risks need to be understood for appropriate technical solutions to be implemented. For instance, proper web security and encryption are sufficient for most public facing web applications. However when money is involved, e.g. with a bank website, extra levels of authentication, encryption, monitoring and auditing are required. Threat modelling is a technique for identifying, preventing and mitigating threats in an optimised way by determining where the most effort should be applied as the system and external factors change.\n  \n &bull; Reliability\nThe probability that the system behaves as designed. No system is 100% reliable, so it needs to be understood what the risk to the business is if a single transaction fails due to system failure. The envisaged design needs to take this into account and find solutions to have the desired reliability, e.g. the system can automatically retry certain steps that are susceptible to network timeouts.\n  \n &bull; Availability\nThe proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. No system is 100% available so the business risks related to any downtime needs to be understood and catered for. If the business loses money for every second the system is down, a high availability like 99.99% up-time may be the service level agreement, thus requiring many levels of redundancy in the system.\n  \n &bull; Maintainability\nThe ease with which defects can be fixed or new features added to the system. Short-lived research applications might not have the same maintainability requirements as a core business application that must last more than 10 years. This is a balancing act of spending extra effort to make the system more maintainable versus using the time to add new features faster. Developers with different personalities types tend to have wildly different natural biases in this regard, so the vision of the business must be clear so that good decisions can be made by the team.\n  \n &bull; Internationalisation\nShould the system be able to be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes? If a front-end does not cater for this from the start, it can be a lot of effort to add this later in the lifecycle.\n  \n 2. Front-end\nMost modern applications are mainly accessed via a web front-end or a mobile application. Unless there are specific business requirements, it usually makes sense to start off on a responsive web application that works on different devices &ndash; the userbase should determine how much effort to put into making it scale well to mobile devices. This is highly dependent on the context of the problem and the users involved.\n  \n A public facing application will almost always need to function well on both mobile and desktop environments, whereas a business facing application might only ever be accessed on a specific platform.\n  \n o Web\nDepending on the business requirements, there are several options for making the system available online. Informative websites typically only contain static web content which is fairly simple to host on premises (low-medium volume) or in the cloud. For high volume static content, a content delivery network (CDN) might be used which spreads the load across the globe.\n  \n There are different ways of implementing web applications that support user interaction. Initially web applications were built using frameworks that rendered the final HTML on the server but this does not scale well. Now we mostly host a single static web page containing a JavaScript library (SPA) on the server and let the final HTML rendering happen on the client browser. A Bootstrap page is loaded first and any additional resources are retrieved as needed. Data access is achieved using data exchange paradigms like REST which is more efficient than transferring fully rendered web pages.\n  \n In order to provide a native-feeling application via the web browser one can implement a progressive web application (PWA). They are built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript so they are intended to work on any platform that uses a modern standards-compliant browser. Functionality that a normal web application doesn&rsquo;t typically provide but that native mobile or desktop apps do provide, can be obtained when implementing a PWA, e.g. working offline, push notifications, device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices.\n  \n o Mobile\n A In order to provide a mobile presence, one can implement multiple native applications using the platform&rsquo;s native tools. This is typically the best user experience for rich applications that need a lot of device interaction and offline capabilities. However, since a completely different application needs to be implemented for each mobile platform (Android, iOS, etc.), it can be costly and finding specialised developers could be a challenge.\n  \n There are alternative options like using a cross-platform framework where one application is developed that works on multiple mobile platforms with a lot less effort than supporting multiple native apps. The frameworks are not perfect as there are limitations and potentially a slightly less-than-native feel to the application, but depending on the business requirement this could be an option.\n As mentioned in the web section, PWAs are also an option with even less specialist skill requirements and effort, but with more limitations.\n  \n 3. Back-end\nAs applications have grown larger and more complex over time, with higher demands on scalability and availability, application architectures have adapted accordingly to support them. Instead of building a monolithic application that is hard to scale out and maintain, applications are typically broken up into several smaller applications or micro services &ndash; each with its own focus, maintenance lifecycle and non-functional requirements (scalability, availability, etc.) .\n  \n Splitting up applications into small pieces helps teams to understand what each service does without keeping the complexity of the entire application in mind. This requires deployments to be automated, services to be automatically discoverable and connections routed accordingly. Asynchronous communications help the system to cope better with spikes and overall stability.\n  \n As back-end systems are broken up into smaller pieces that can be maintained by separate teams, it can make sense to also split up the front-ends. This ensures that each team is only responsible for maintaining their little piece and allowing different maintenance and framework upgrade cycles &ndash; which can be difficult in a big front-end application. There is typically an overarching application that stitches together the individual pieces.\n  \n  \n Historically all applications were hosted in private data centres that had to be maintained by teams of specialised system administrators. Cloud computing seeks to commoditise computing infrastructure by implementing large scale data centres that can be optimised and provide highly reliable and scalable infrastructure with less effort to get set up and maintain. Most hosting is quickly moving to the cloud, as it is more cost effective and reliable in most cases. However, many businesses still use physical and virtual servers. Private cloud hosting can be an option, but one would still need a team that can support it.\n  \n To be cost effective in the cloud requires that the application be designed to work efficiently in the cloud. The traditional mindset of having a virtual server that you maintain manually in the cloud will be more costly. With the &lsquo;serverless&rsquo; model, the application pieces are hosted on shared infrastructure that is highly tuned for each type of workload. That way the business just pays for each usage of the system instead of renting fixed hardware that sits idle most of the time.\n  \n 4. Persistence\nThis is an area where incorrect decisions can have a long-term impact, beyond the life of the solution itself. Data stores tend to outlive the application itself and have value to the business outside of just what the application it was built for does.\n  \n There are some important questions to ask when choosing a persistence layer:\n \n&bull; What is being stored, and for what purpose? \n&bull; Is the data heavily numeric with a requirement to perform complicated calculations on that data? \n&bull; Is it high-volume event data from IoT devices where the individual events are less important than trends and anomalies? \n&bull; Is it unstructured, where there&rsquo;s no defined or expected schema, or where the schema is expected to change frequently?\n  \n &bull; Types of persistence\n\nThere are several types of databases available today. The relational database - historically the most popular database type - is joined by document databases, graph databases, key-value stores and more. The choice of database type should be guided by the type of data being stored, not by what is popular in the media. A poor decision here can have major repercussions throughout the application&rsquo;s development and usage.\n  \n &bull; Picking a solution\nThe type of data being stored is not the only consideration. Consistency and data security are two other important aspects that must be taken into account before deciding on a database platform.\n  \n Consistency is about the behaviour of the system under concurrent reads and writes. If three processes write to the database and then a fourth one reads, is it important that the fourth process sees all three of the writes? Is it going to break anything in the application if it only sees the first two? Or if it only sees the third write? Typically, relational database engines only support strong consistency, meaning that in the example the fourth process would always see all three writes, while non-relational databases support eventual consistency, meaning the fourth process could see any combination of the writes, including none of them. There are exceptions however, with some modern database systems offering selectable consistency models.\n  \n Data security has always been important, but the increasing frequency of data breaches and the existence of laws such as GDPR have brought it into focus. This isn&rsquo;t just a matter of whether the database engine has any known security vulnerabilities. It&rsquo;s also about auditing, encryption, granularity of permissions and a lot more.\n  \n Is there sensitive data in the database that needs to be stored encrypted? If so, and the database chosen does not support such encryption, then the application development gains extra complexity as the encryption would have to be implemented within the application. Depending on the requirements, it may also be worth investigating how and where keys can be stored, what kind of work would be required to rotate keys, and whether the encryption protects the data against the administrators of the servers or not.\n  \n Does access to certain types of data need to be tracked and audited? Do changes need to be audited? Do schema changes, in the case of relational databases, need to be audited? These are often not obvious requirements when the initial application requirements are detailed, but they are critically important nonetheless.\n  \n Once all the technical requirements are out of the way, there&rsquo;s also the question of existing skills and investments. This isn&rsquo;t just a matter of what the development team is familiar with, but also what your operations teams are familiar with. Training is costly and time-consuming, so introducing a completely new database engine may not be desirable. This goes for infrastructure and cloud investments as well. What you have in terms of infrastructure and where they&rsquo;re investing in a cloud footprint (or if you're staying completely on-prem) can also affect the choice of database engine used for the application.\n  \n 5. Business intelligence\nToday businesses collect large amounts of data and information that can be used to derive real-world value. This is what business intelligence (BI) excels at, as it comprises of the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for data analysis of business information. This information is often used to provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations and facilitates efficient and effective decision-making, and enables automation of current business processes. Time to value, e.g. BI projects have demonstrated that even in organisations that are improving their BI maturity, the time to value is very low and insights can be obtained in a few weeks. However, to ensure your initiatives are sustainable, the organisation will eventually have to mature and get the necessary infrastructure in place.\n  \n Most of the market-leading BI tools these days are so similarly matched that the biggest contributing factors in deciding which tool to use comes down to how much data transformation needs to be handled by the tool itself and the total cost of ownership. When a business decides to embark on the BI journey, it's important to take an approach that will future-proof the solution. This means spending most of the time curating your data effectively. Start by establishing a data warehouse solution whereby business principles and logic are built into a foundation layer that is centrally located and controlled. What this will enable is the ability to implement any BI tool on top of this established data warehouse, and provide the versatility and flexibility to easily substitute the BI tool being used, should there be the need to do so. This ensures the sustainability of an entire BI solution.\n  \n Once a healthy foundation is set, the BI tools themselves need to be compared to determine which tool would be the best business fit. Some of the aspects that need to be considered are:\n  \n &bull; Development time\nThis involves the amount of time required to get the BI project up and running. The development time directly impacts the overall development cost of the project.\n  \n &bull; User experience\nChoosing a BI tool that is easy to use, simple to understand and aesthetically pleasing to look at, will aid in the tools adoption rate and overall success of the solution.\n  \n &bull; Security\nThe capability of restricting data to only be viewed by certain individuals or ensuring that all the data in a BI model is safe has become a standard in all BI reporting tools. There are however various methods that can be used to facilitate this function.\n  \n &bull; Self-service\nGenerally, in any business there should be a few &ldquo;power users&rdquo;. The ease with which these users create a particular view, dashboard or develop their own model to save on development costs is referred to as the self-service aspect of a tool.\n  \n &bull; License cost\nThe costs associated with implementing and maintaining the tool generally involves a licensing cost. This could either be a single enterprise wide licensing cost and/or licensing cost per user. This is one of the most important aspects to choosing the correct BI tool for an organisation.\n  \n &bull; Functionality\nAlthough a lot of the market-leading BI tools share similar features and have more or less the same capabilities, careful consideration should be given to the overall goal of the organisation and the capabilities that will be required for the particular task at hand.\n  \n &bull; Customisability\nBI tools offer a wide range of customisability in terms of the look and feel. This usually involves adding corporate identity to any model that will be developed.\n  \n &bull; Embedding\nEmbedding of models have become a very popular addition in many BI tools. This allows models to be incorporated into a web interface allowing a seamless transition from, for example an intranet site to the BI tool. This greatly improves the adoption rate within an organisation as there is no need to alternate between two interfaces to access the tools.\n  \n &bull; Push reports\nMany years ago, it was common to pull your reports from the BI tools, however, a shift has come whereby push reporting capabilities have been incorporated. This allows users to be sent reports in various formats via email. Removing the need to go to the tool itself and pull data.\n  \n &bull; Integrations\nBI tools allow integration between other components such as Python, R and other statistical tools. Additionally, the capabilities of connecting to various data sources forms part of the integration capabilities and is an important consideration as not all of the tools are able to connect to an equal amount of data sources and some tools require additional expenditure to facilitate connecting to particular source systems.\n  \n 6. Take aways\nA team with experience using a variety of technologies can give expert advice from lessons learned, what the new trends are and common pitfalls. Make sure the vision for the solution is clear and the functional and non-functional requirements are understood in advance to avoid future re-work, but don&rsquo;t try to do everything at once: figure out what the MVP is so that a working application can be delivered quickly. Then feedback and changing business requirements can be incorporated to meet the business demands as needed.\n Read the full From Here to There publication&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:20888,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:20932}">

<div><a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software plays a role in almost every part of every business. Technical teams are responsible for understanding the digital landscape within the organisation and outside of it. This includes selecting the most sensible tools and frameworks to solve problems, and designing software using best practices to enable maintainable solutions that can evolve going forward.<br /><br />In order to make system design decisions, some level of understanding is needed of what the envisioned functional and non-functional requirements are. The following questions need to be answered:<br /><br />&bull; What is the problem we are trying to solve? <br />&bull; Who/what will use it? <br />&bull; What does the existing technology landscape look like and what integrations are needed? <br />&bull; How must it scale and perform? <br />&bull; Who is going to develop and maintain it? <br />&bull; What technical skills are available?<br /><br />Taking the answers to these questions into account, we will be able to make critical decisions like:<br /><br />&bull; Where the solution will be deployed and hosted?<br />&bull; Which technologies will be used to build the solution?<br />&bull; What the plan is for scaling up under load?<br />&bull; What security measures are needed?<br />&bull; How does the solution fit into the greater technology ecosystem?<br /><br />There are several technology and deployment stacks available today, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. There are differences to what each technology is good at and the ease with which they can be used to implement different types of solutions, but often the deciding factor is what skills are available in the team who is to develop and maintain it and where the team is going strategically. As new technologies come out frequently one does want to be a little conservative: one should make sure any proposed technology has a proven track record with regards to scalability and maintainability.<br /><br />1. Architecture<br />When designing a solution there are many technical architecture considerations known as non-functional requirements that need to be considered. Even if most of these requirements are not implemented at the start, it is essential to keep them in mind from the beginning and have a clear understanding of how provision will be made when the time comes to cater for them. This is needed because these types of requirements typically take much more effort to implement later in the life of the solution if no consideration was given to them early on. Some examples are mentioned on the next page.<br /><br />&bull; Scalability<br />This is how system resources are added to handle a growing amount of work, e.g. adding memory to the database host or adding another node on a cluster. Some applications (especially legacy applications) can only be scaled vertically. This means more resources like memory or CPU power must be added to a single server in order to get better performance. However this has physical limits, and costs increase faster than the improvement in performance. It is preferable for an application to allow horizontal scaling to allow adding more average powered nodes to a cluster for better performance. This is typically more cost-effective and has many secondary benefits, such as better availability and reliability.<br /><br />&bull; Throughput<br />The rate at which the system must be able to handle requests, e.g. the number of transactions per second the system must cater for.<br /><br />&bull; Performance<br />The amount of useful work accomplished by the system with a given amount of resources, e.g. having a low response time or low resource utilisation.<br /><br />&bull; Volumes<br />How much data the system must be able to handle, e.g. storing two million records per year or handle 1MB file imports.<br /><br />&bull; Security<br />The resilience the system has against potential harm, unwanted changes and data leaks. No system is 100% secure. The key business risks need to be understood for appropriate technical solutions to be implemented. For instance, proper web security and encryption are sufficient for most public facing web applications. However when money is involved, e.g. with a bank website, extra levels of authentication, encryption, monitoring and auditing are required. Threat modelling is a technique for identifying, preventing and mitigating threats in an optimised way by determining where the most effort should be applied as the system and external factors change.<br /><br />&bull; Reliability<br />The probability that the system behaves as designed. No system is 100% reliable, so it needs to be understood what the risk to the business is if a single transaction fails due to system failure. The envisaged design needs to take this into account and find solutions to have the desired reliability, e.g. the system can automatically retry certain steps that are susceptible to network timeouts.<br /><br />&bull; Availability<br />The proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. No system is 100% available so the business risks related to any downtime needs to be understood and catered for. If the business loses money for every second the system is down, a high availability like 99.99% up-time may be the service level agreement, thus requiring many levels of redundancy in the system.<br /><br />&bull; Maintainability<br />The ease with which defects can be fixed or new features added to the system. Short-lived research applications might not have the same maintainability requirements as a core business application that must last more than 10 years. This is a balancing act of spending extra effort to make the system more maintainable versus using the time to add new features faster. Developers with different personalities types tend to have wildly different natural biases in this regard, so the vision of the business must be clear so that good decisions can be made by the team.<br /><br />&bull; Internationalisation<br />Should the system be able to be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes? If a front-end does not cater for this from the start, it can be a lot of effort to add this later in the lifecycle.<br /><br />2. Front-end<br />Most modern applications are mainly accessed via a web front-end or a mobile application. Unless there are specific business requirements, it usually makes sense to start off on a responsive web application that works on different devices &ndash; the userbase should determine how much effort to put into making it scale well to mobile devices. This is highly dependent on the context of the problem and the users involved.<br /><br />A public facing application will almost always need to function well on both mobile and desktop environments, whereas a business facing application might only ever be accessed on a specific platform.<br /><br />o Web<br />Depending on the business requirements, there are several options for making the system available online. Informative websites typically only contain static web content which is fairly simple to host on premises (low-medium volume) or in the cloud. For high volume static content, a content delivery network (CDN) might be used which spreads the load across the globe.<br /><br />There are different ways of implementing web applications that support user interaction. Initially web applications were built using frameworks that rendered the final HTML on the server but this does not scale well. Now we mostly host a single static web page containing a JavaScript library (SPA) on the server and let the final HTML rendering happen on the client browser. A Bootstrap page is loaded first and any additional resources are retrieved as needed. Data access is achieved using data exchange paradigms like REST which is more efficient than transferring fully rendered web pages.<br /><br />In order to provide a native-feeling application via the web browser one can implement a progressive web application (PWA). They are built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript so they are intended to work on any platform that uses a modern standards-compliant browser. Functionality that a normal web application doesn&rsquo;t typically provide but that native mobile or desktop apps do provide, can be obtained when implementing a PWA, e.g. working offline, push notifications, device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices.<br /><br />o Mobile<br />A In order to provide a mobile presence, one can implement multiple native applications using the platform&rsquo;s native tools. This is typically the best user experience for rich applications that need a lot of device interaction and offline capabilities. However, since a completely different application needs to be implemented for each mobile platform (Android, iOS, etc.), it can be costly and finding specialised developers could be a challenge.<br /><br />There are alternative options like using a cross-platform framework where one application is developed that works on multiple mobile platforms with a lot less effort than supporting multiple native apps. The frameworks are not perfect as there are limitations and potentially a slightly less-than-native feel to the application, but depending on the business requirement this could be an option.<br />As mentioned in the web section, PWAs are also an option with even less specialist skill requirements and effort, but with more limitations.<br /><br />3. Back-end<br />As applications have grown larger and more complex over time, with higher demands on scalability and availability, application architectures have adapted accordingly to support them. Instead of building a monolithic application that is hard to scale out and maintain, applications are typically broken up into several smaller applications or micro services &ndash; each with its own focus, maintenance lifecycle and non-functional requirements (scalability, availability, etc.) .<br /><br />Splitting up applications into small pieces helps teams to understand what each service does without keeping the complexity of the entire application in mind. This requires deployments to be automated, services to be automatically discoverable and connections routed accordingly. Asynchronous communications help the system to cope better with spikes and overall stability.<br /><br />As back-end systems are broken up into smaller pieces that can be maintained by separate teams, it can make sense to also split up the front-ends. This ensures that each team is only responsible for maintaining their little piece and allowing different maintenance and framework upgrade cycles &ndash; which can be difficult in a big front-end application. There is typically an overarching application that stitches together the individual pieces.<br /><br /><br />Historically all applications were hosted in private data centres that had to be maintained by teams of specialised system administrators. Cloud computing seeks to commoditise computing infrastructure by implementing large scale data centres that can be optimised and provide highly reliable and scalable infrastructure with less effort to get set up and maintain. Most hosting is quickly moving to the cloud, as it is more cost effective and reliable in most cases. However, many businesses still use physical and virtual servers. Private cloud hosting can be an option, but one would still need a team that can support it.<br /><br />To be cost effective in the cloud requires that the application be designed to work efficiently in the cloud. The traditional mindset of having a virtual server that you maintain manually in the cloud will be more costly. With the &lsquo;serverless&rsquo; model, the application pieces are hosted on shared infrastructure that is highly tuned for each type of workload. That way the business just pays for each usage of the system instead of renting fixed hardware that sits idle most of the time.<br /><br />4. Persistence<br />This is an area where incorrect decisions can have a long-term impact, beyond the life of the solution itself. Data stores tend to outlive the application itself and have value to the business outside of just what the application it was built for does.<br /><br />There are some important questions to ask when choosing a persistence layer:<br /><br />&bull; What is being stored, and for what purpose? <br />&bull; Is the data heavily numeric with a requirement to perform complicated calculations on that data? <br />&bull; Is it high-volume event data from IoT devices where the individual events are less important than trends and anomalies? <br />&bull; Is it unstructured, where there&rsquo;s no defined or expected schema, or where the schema is expected to change frequently?<br /><br />&bull; Types of persistence<br /><br />There are several types of databases available today. The relational database - historically the most popular database type - is joined by document databases, graph databases, key-value stores and more. The choice of database type should be guided by the type of data being stored, not by what is popular in the media. A poor decision here can have major repercussions throughout the application&rsquo;s development and usage.<br /><br />&bull; Picking a solution<br />The type of data being stored is not the only consideration. Consistency and data security are two other important aspects that must be taken into account before deciding on a database platform.<br /><br />Consistency is about the behaviour of the system under concurrent reads and writes. If three processes write to the database and then a fourth one reads, is it important that the fourth process sees all three of the writes? Is it going to break anything in the application if it only sees the first two? Or if it only sees the third write? Typically, relational database engines only support strong consistency, meaning that in the example the fourth process would always see all three writes, while non-relational databases support eventual consistency, meaning the fourth process could see any combination of the writes, including none of them. There are exceptions however, with some modern database systems offering selectable consistency models.<br /><br />Data security has always been important, but the increasing frequency of data breaches and the existence of laws such as GDPR have brought it into focus. This isn&rsquo;t just a matter of whether the database engine has any known security vulnerabilities. It&rsquo;s also about auditing, encryption, granularity of permissions and a lot more.<br /><br />Is there sensitive data in the database that needs to be stored encrypted? If so, and the database chosen does not support such encryption, then the application development gains extra complexity as the encryption would have to be implemented within the application. Depending on the requirements, it may also be worth investigating how and where keys can be stored, what kind of work would be required to rotate keys, and whether the encryption protects the data against the administrators of the servers or not.<br /><br />Does access to certain types of data need to be tracked and audited? Do changes need to be audited? Do schema changes, in the case of relational databases, need to be audited? These are often not obvious requirements when the initial application requirements are detailed, but they are critically important nonetheless.<br /><br />Once all the technical requirements are out of the way, there&rsquo;s also the question of existing skills and investments. This isn&rsquo;t just a matter of what the development team is familiar with, but also what your operations teams are familiar with. Training is costly and time-consuming, so introducing a completely new database engine may not be desirable. This goes for infrastructure and cloud investments as well. What you have in terms of infrastructure and where they&rsquo;re investing in a cloud footprint (or if you're staying completely on-prem) can also affect the choice of database engine used for the application.<br /><br />5.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Developers are hired to solve business problems, but in the world of software development there often end up being many menial, repetitive tasks. There are multiple issues with developers performing these tasks manually:\n\n&bull; They are not providing direct value to the business when distracted with these tasks\n&bull; Humans are prone to error when doing the same thing over and over (as we become familiar, we become over-confident and make silly mistakes)\n&bull; The tasks are not challenging to the mind of a developer which can cause boredom and a lack of job satisfaction\n  \n Fortunately, many of these repetitive tasks are nothing more than a set of well-defined steps that need to be executed in a specific sequence, often depending on the output of the previous step. These are perfect candidates for automation.\n  \n The following war cry sums it up well: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s important and repetitive, then automate it!&rdquo;.\n  \n 1. Foundations of software development automation\n  \n An extremely important practice is required to enable automation. This practice is source control, or sometimes called version control.\n  \n Source control allows a team to track changes made to the source code as features are developed. Developers can see a comprehensive history of changes made as well as jump around that history to revert to a specific point in time.\n  \n These practices also allow for the &ldquo;branching&rdquo; of code which enables developers to make sweeping changes without affecting the work of others. There are various strategies around branching, each with their own pros and cons, but the two most popular are:\n \n1) Trunk-based or master-based development: All work is continuously merged into the main branch, even if the feature is not yet complete.\n \n2) Feature branches: Work is done on a separate branch and only merged into the main branch once complete.\n  \n Besides the primary benefits of a source control system, maintaining the source of an application in a centralised, version-controlled repository is the key to unlocking many of the automations mentioned below.\n  \n 2. Types of automation\n  \n There are many kinds of tasks that are performed across all software projects, there are also unique tasks per specific project. Most of these tasks can be automated. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some generally accepted best practices for automation in the life of building a solution.\n  \n &bull; Continuous integration\n \nEventually, most software projects grow large, and the development teams expand to cope with the demand for new features and maintenance. This results in many parallel branches of the code existing at the same time and in various states.\n  \n These branches will have to be merged together (and back into the main branch) at some point. There is a high risk of merging errors, as well as logic bugs when this code comes together, especially if the branches have lived alone for any extended period. The solution is to merge all branches regularly and to make sure everything is always working all the time. This process is known as &ldquo;continuous integration,&rdquo; and is defined by Martin Fowler as &ldquo;a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including automated tests) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.&rdquo;\n  \n Another advantage of this automated integration is a consistent build. We have a well-defined automated process that produces binaries to be deployed onto some environment. This removes the risk of a developer having some specific setup that no-one else can replicate and resulting in only that developer being able to build for a release. We also remove the commonly used &ldquo;but it works on my machine&rdquo; excuse. If it doesn&rsquo;t build on the build server, it doesn&rsquo;t go to production.\n  \n &bull; Automated testing\n \nAn extremely important part of continuous integration is the execution of all automated tests. These tests should be written by the developers as a safety net that gives them confidence to make changes without accidentally breaking something else in the code base.\n  \n In the diagram, the bottom 3 levels can be automated with varying degrees of difficulty.\n  \n Unit tests are the most straight-forward to automate as they should be small self-contained tests that only confirm the functionality of a single piece of code under very specific conditions. These tests should have no outside dependencies (or all dependencies are mocked out) so that they can be executed over and over with no side-effects.\n Integration tests are used to ensure that blocks of functionality can talk to each other successfully. This may mean accessing a database or file system, or calling a service over the network. These types of tests may also check the flow of data through the entire system. Automated integration tests are harder to set up, as they often require a valid database to access (with valid test data pre-populated) or real services to call.\n  \n Acceptance tests exist to make sure that the end-to-end solution being built meets the requirements specified by the business. In systems with a user interface, these often take the form of scripted steps through a specific flow, recording and verifying along the way that the system is behaving as expected. For non-UI systems, these tests may include loading production-like data into the system and checking the output. Acceptance tests require a deployed instance of the application to be executed on.\n  \n Whatever the type of test, running them manually would put a huge strain on the team and severely affect delivery. Executing the tests on every code check-in (or once a day for heavier integration and acceptance tests) provides confidence in the changes being made with very little effort from the team required (beyond writing the tests when functionality is built).\n  \n &bull; Automated deployment/continuous delivery\n  \n Deploying an application into an environment can take many forms. In most cases there is a file copy involved, and often there are multiple steps involved before and after the file copy. These steps could theoretically be documented as a recipe for someone to follow when deploying, but there is still room for error when a human gets involved with simple, repetitive tasks.\n  \n  \n An application could also be deployed to various testing environments on its way through the production environment. To get feedback quickly, it&rsquo;s a good idea to deploy the latest changes to a test environment as they are made. Doing all these deployments manually would be a huge time sink for the team.\n  \n At a minimum, deployments should be executed by a script. In an ideal world, that script should be controlled by a system that can put permissions and auditing around when a script is executed, who executed it and what the results of that execution were.\n  \n &bull; Provisioning and scaling\n \nIn this era of cloud-based computing, it is also possible to automate the provisioning of resources for the consumption of our application. We can spin up an entirely new environment just to run a set of tests and then tear it down again when done.\n  \n We may have a system that provides functionality for adding new customers each with their own dedicated resources. These resources can be automatically provisioned on demand.\n  \n &bull; Monitoring\n \nOnce an application is released into the wild, it is extremely important to ensure that it continues running well and that any errors or unexpected behaviour is picked up immediately. Systems should be put in place that alert the team to anomalies, instead of requiring someone to watch dashboards all day or sift through thousands of system generated error reports. Artificial intelligence can also play an important role in identifying unusual trends.\n  \n 3.

<div><a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developers are hired to solve business problems, but in the world of software development there often end up being many menial, repetitive tasks. There are multiple issues with developers performing these tasks manually:<br /><br />&bull; They are not providing direct value to the business when distracted with these tasks<br />&bull; Humans are prone to error when doing the same thing over and over (as we become familiar, we become over-confident and make silly mistakes)<br />&bull; The tasks are not challenging to the mind of a developer which can cause boredom and a lack of job satisfaction<br /><br />Fortunately, many of these repetitive tasks are nothing more than a set of well-defined steps that need to be executed in a specific sequence, often depending on the output of the previous step. These are perfect candidates for automation.<br /><br />The following war cry sums it up well: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s important and repetitive, then automate it!&rdquo;.<br /><br />1. Foundations of software development automation<br /><br />An extremely important practice is required to enable automation. This practice is source control, or sometimes called version control.<br /><br />Source control allows a team to track changes made to the source code as features are developed. Developers can see a comprehensive history of changes made as well as jump around that history to revert to a specific point in time.<br /><br />These practices also allow for the &ldquo;branching&rdquo; of code which enables developers to make sweeping changes without affecting the work of others. There are various strategies around branching, each with their own pros and cons, but the two most popular are:<br /><br />1) Trunk-based or master-based development: All work is continuously merged into the main branch, even if the feature is not yet complete.<br /><br />2) Feature branches: Work is done on a separate branch and only merged into the main branch once complete.<br /><br />Besides the primary benefits of a source control system, maintaining the source of an application in a centralised, version-controlled repository is the key to unlocking many of the automations mentioned below.<br /><br />2. Types of automation<br /><br />There are many kinds of tasks that are performed across all software projects, there are also unique tasks per specific project. Most of these tasks can be automated. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some generally accepted best practices for automation in the life of building a solution.<br /><br />&bull; Continuous integration<br /><br />Eventually, most software projects grow large, and the development teams expand to cope with the demand for new features and maintenance. This results in many parallel branches of the code existing at the same time and in various states.<br /><br />These branches will have to be merged together (and back into the main branch) at some point. There is a high risk of merging errors, as well as logic bugs when this code comes together, especially if the branches have lived alone for any extended period. The solution is to merge all branches regularly and to make sure everything is always working all the time. This process is known as &ldquo;continuous integration,&rdquo; and is defined by Martin Fowler as &ldquo;a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including automated tests) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.&rdquo;<br /><br />Another advantage of this automated integration is a consistent build. We have a well-defined automated process that produces binaries to be deployed onto some environment. This removes the risk of a developer having some specific setup that no-one else can replicate and resulting in only that developer being able to build for a release. We also remove the commonly used &ldquo;but it works on my machine&rdquo; excuse. If it doesn&rsquo;t build on the build server, it doesn&rsquo;t go to production.<br /><br />&bull; Automated testing<br /><br />An extremely important part of continuous integration is the execution of all automated tests. These tests should be written by the developers as a safety net that gives them confidence to make changes without accidentally breaking something else in the code base.<br /><br />In the diagram, the bottom 3 levels can be automated with varying degrees of difficulty.<br /><br />Unit tests are the most straight-forward to automate as they should be small self-contained tests that only confirm the functionality of a single piece of code under very specific conditions. These tests should have no outside dependencies (or all dependencies are mocked out) so that they can be executed over and over with no side-effects.<br />Integration tests are used to ensure that blocks of functionality can talk to each other successfully. This may mean accessing a database or file system, or calling a service over the network. These types of tests may also check the flow of data through the entire system. Automated integration tests are harder to set up, as they often require a valid database to access (with valid test data pre-populated) or real services to call.<br /><br />Acceptance tests exist to make sure that the end-to-end solution being built meets the requirements specified by the business. In systems with a user interface, these often take the form of scripted steps through a specific flow, recording and verifying along the way that the system is behaving as expected. For non-UI systems, these tests may include loading production-like data into the system and checking the output. Acceptance tests require a deployed instance of the application to be executed on.<br /><br />Whatever the type of test, running them manually would put a huge strain on the team and severely affect delivery. Executing the tests on every code check-in (or once a day for heavier integration and acceptance tests) provides confidence in the changes being made with very little effort from the team required (beyond writing the tests when functionality is built).<br /><br />&bull; Automated deployment/continuous delivery<br /><br />Deploying an application into an environment can take many forms. In most cases there is a file copy involved, and often there are multiple steps involved before and after the file copy. These steps could theoretically be documented as a recipe for someone to follow when deploying, but there is still room for error when a human gets involved with simple, repetitive tasks.<br /><br /><br />An application could also be deployed to various testing environments on its way through the production environment. To get feedback quickly, it&rsquo;s a good idea to deploy the latest changes to a test environment as they are made. Doing all these deployments manually would be a huge time sink for the team.<br /><br />At a minimum, deployments should be executed by a script. In an ideal world, that script should be controlled by a system that can put permissions and auditing around when a script is executed, who executed it and what the results of that execution were.<br /><br />&bull; Provisioning and scaling<br /><br />In this era of cloud-based computing, it is also possible to automate the provisioning of resources for the consumption of our application. We can spin up an entirely new environment just to run a set of tests and then tear it down again when done.<br /><br />We may have a system that provides functionality for adding new customers each with their own dedicated resources. These resources can be automatically provisioned on demand.<br /><br />&bull; Monitoring<br /><br />Once an application is released into the wild, it is extremely important to ensure that it continues running well and that any errors or unexpected behaviour is picked up immediately. Systems should be put in place that alert the team to anomalies, instead of requiring someone to watch dashboards all day or sift through thousands of system generated error reports. Artificial intelligence can also play an important role in identifying unusual trends.<br /><br />3. Automation tooling<br /><br />As with many tools available in the software development world, there is a wide variety of tools and systems that will help a team accomplish its automation goals.<br /><br />&bull; Scripting tools<br /><br />Scripts allow the chaining together of commands into a single parameterised command. Initially, the team would execute the scripts themselves until they feel confident they are performing as intended.<br /><br />&bull; DevOps tools<br /><br />The term DevOps is used to describe a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations teams in order to shorten the cycle of delivering working software and realising business value. Automation falls into these practices and there are many software solutions available in this space.<br /><br />A team should invest in these systems so that they are able to automate and control the execution of the scripts (or extend them with further capabilities) and provide additional functionality such as permissions, logging, remote execution, scheduling, etc.<br /><br />There are many players in this field and the choice of system would depend on many factors:<br /><br />o What technologies are used to build the application?<br />o Are there operating system constraints on the build tools?<br />o Does the organisation have preferred software vendors?<br />o Is it suitable to execute builds and tests in the cloud, or must it be on-prem?<br /><br /></a><a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the full From Here to There publication</a></div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Once an idea has made its journey into an implemented solution, it is necessary to make sure the original need has been met. Just because something is in production, it does not necessarily mean it is doing what it should be, and often it&rsquo;s difficult to tell straight away.\n  \n There are various techniques that can be used to measure the success of an implementation, both from a business point of view as well as technical.\n  \n 1. Measuring technical success\nThere are many things that could potentially fail in a live system. Many of these risks would have been considered when making technology stack choices and while implementing the solution. But there is still a very important need to keep a close eye on what is happening in real time and to be prepared to act as soon as something fails.\n  \n &bull; Gathering metrics\n A software system has the potential to generate large amounts of data related to the way it is functioning. This data can take various forms:\n \no Text log files\no Database log entries\no Hardware performance metrics\n \nGathering all this data presents some unique challenges, substantial amounts of storage are required and there is a risk of overloading support staff to the degree that important information is missed or ignored.\n  \n &bull; Making sense of metrics\nSimply gathering data is not useful to the business or technical team unless they are able to glean insights from it. The data needs to be processed and analysed (in an automated tool) so that trends and anomalies are easily identified. Artificial intelligence and statistical analysis have the potential to find things in the data that most humans would miss.\n  \n  \n &bull; Radiating information\nOnce trends and worrying issues are identified, the relevant stakeholders need to be made aware of them. Simply emailing reports is likely to get them filtered away and ignored. The insights need to be on display all the time and radiating throughout the workspace of the people responsible for the health of the solution.\n  \n Permanent dashboards displayed on TVs are a great way to radiate information. They do, however, need to be well thought out to be the most effective. Make sure that anomalies are instantly visible, show trends over time so that unusual changes stick out. There is also room for showing successful metrics to promote confidence in the health of the system.\n  \n 2. Measuring business success\nAs part of the implementation process, a business intelligence (BI) solution would have been chosen and put into place. Now is the time to leverage that effort to measure the business success of the implemented idea. The chosen BI stack will allow stakeholders to slice and dice the data in order to extract key metrics and indicators.\n  \n  \n &bull; The data pyramid\nThe data pyramid shows how reporting, roles and use cases for the data change in a mature data environment. The insights gained, frequency and granularity of the underlying data, and audience viewing the reports change, depending on the layer of the pyramid.\n  \n At the bottom layer, reporting is primarily based on transactional or &ldquo;near real time&rdquo; information. This serves the purpose of showcasing the as-is processes within the business and serves to improve visibility of business processes.\n  \n On the upper layers, reporting becomes more analytical and strategic in nature, providing a more aggregated view of information which could help better infer trends, which assists management in doing comparative analysis and scenario planning, among others. This helps identify where a business needs to be and what adjustments need to be made in order to better reach business goals. This is achieved by enabling an accurate view of key indicators tracked against organisational targets.\n  \n The capstone of the data pyramid is predictive and prescriptive analytics that come into play through the use of data science. Predictive analytics indicates what is likely to happen in future (i.e. what will happen), whereas prescriptive analytics refers to recommended actions and strategies (i.e. what to do about it).\n  \n The BI maturity model and the data pyramid work hand-in-hand. Having a mature data environment naturally enables more analytical data use cases through the insights journey below.\n  \n  \n &bull; The BI Maturity Model\nEach organisation or division is on a journey to an optimised data warehouse (DWH). Even a mature and optimised DWH will still change as new analytical requirements are discovered and as new trends emerge in the field.\n  \n The reporting and analytical requirements of an entity change significantly as they move through the steps in the BI maturity model, as explained to the right. Please note that an entity could be in more than one level across different facets of their business.\n  \n Stage 1\nThis stage represents the pre-data warehouse environment where an organisation relies entirely on operational reports for information. In general, these reports are static and inflexible and show a limited range of data for a limited set of processes providing little benefit to the organisation. During this stage it is mostly spreadsheets on local machines that are used to support the reporting requirement of the organisation.\n Stage 2\nThe entity&rsquo;s first attempt at a BI solution, where an initiative is started by a department without fully understanding all the fundamental requirements of a successful BI solution. The first BI tools are introduced - primarily for ad-hoc queries, reporting and basic OLAP - where licences are given to only a handful of power users and analysts. Benefits are starting to be derived, but only by a handful of people within the organisation.\n Stage 3\nAt this point, a business unit recognises the value of consolidating these silos of information into a single data warehouse to save money and gain greater consistency in the information it uses to understand and analyse the business.\n Stage 4\nAn area is entered where BI/DWH delivers a strategic, enterprise resource that enables organisations to achieve their key objectives. This is accomplished through a unified data warehousing architecture defined by a common set of semantics and rules for terms and metrics shared across the business.\n Stage 5\nThis phase completes the cycle by converting core BI/DWH capabilities into services, both technical and commercial, and redistributing development back out to the business units via centres of excellence.\n  \n Stage 6\nWith a well-established curated DWH solution in place, true value can be derived from BI by using predictive and prescriptive analytics that come into play by incorporating data science. The focus shifts from looking at the past, to trying to look into the future by learning from mistakes made or improving on past successes.\n  \n  \n Read the full From Here to There publication&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:6777,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://culture.entelect.co.za/our-engineering/disruptive-software-2019/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:6821}">

Here are three recommendations based on our experience of operating offshore delivery teams.\n _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ Rethink culture\n _linebreak_It is difficult to maintain a sense of singular purpose and team across remote boundaries, let alone across continents. Team culture should therefore be adapted accordingly._linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 1. Build a one-team mindset\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Fostering trust, inclusion, team-based accountability and cultural affinity should be a core focus for leaders in offshoring engagements that value high-performance.\n _linebreak_ Leaders should model the mindset and behaviours of a unified team. This means demonstrating respect, fairness, and treating all participants involved in a delivery as a singular team, with shared goals and priorities.\n _linebreak_ Hold everyone to a common performance standard, and ensure that accountability is held at a team-level for the success or failure of goals and commitments.\n _linebreak_ Eliminate favouritism, disrespectful behaviour, cultural biases, and 'us and them' attitudes.\n _linebreak_ Involve both sides of the border in planning, estimations, decision making and social interactions where possible.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 2. Assign team ambassadors\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Make the one-team mindset somebody's core responsibility, on both sides.\n _linebreak_ Relationship building activities are the bedrock of trust, respect and a highly collaborative work environment.\n _linebreak_ This is a full-time job that requires two willing parties to own the following responsibilities:_linebreak_ _linebreak_ To own and manage the delivery and expectations on both sides.\n _linebreak_ To act as ambassadors for their teams and people to the other side, to ensure that cross-border trust, alignment and affinity is cared for throughout the engagement.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak_\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 3. Encourage many-to-many relationships\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Let problem-solvers on both sides talk directly with those who can help on the other side. Don&rsquo;t let hierarchy or process prevent people from building natural, synchronous and useful relationships that help them get their work done.\n _linebreak_ Allow for communication to flow openly between team members across shores and avoid strict communication protocols that filter everything through a single person.\n _linebreak_ Make sure the teams understand what communication tools are available to them, and when they are appropriate.\n _linebreak_ Prioritise face-time between teams regularly. This requires sacrifices on both sides due to time-zone differences and busy calendars, but it is necessary to maintain alignment and to prevent drifting expectations.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 4. Be explicit in your ways of working\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Standards, processes and tools need to be discussed and agreed upon clearly by everyone using them.\n _linebreak_ If this mindset is shared by your onshore and offshore teams, you generate buy-in, compliance, and eliminate misunderstanding.\n _linebreak_ A singular team, means a singular method of operation unless otherwise prescribed.\n _linebreak_ At the start of a new offshoring engagement, expect to take a bit of pain to onboard a new delivery team into your ways of working.\n _linebreak_ Spend time defining, sharing and campaigning for your ways of working on an ongoing basis. This can be driven by the team-ambassadors on both sides.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ Design workflow for asynchronicity\n _linebreak_Operating software teams remotely and across conflicting time zones requires us to adapt our delivery processes and commit time differently to getting it right in an asynchronous setup._linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 1. Plan and deliver differently\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ You cannot make decisions as quickly or easily as when you have everyone co-located in the same time zone. That does not mean that you cannot be agile and change direction, it means you just need more discipline to adhere to your sprint plan.\n _linebreak_ Plan features so that dependencies are minimised where possible. Alternatively, you can do this by creating modularised work packages that can be tackled independently.\n _linebreak_ Turnaround times on questions can be a major obstacle, and so you need to manage technical questions and resolution as a matter of process. A useful way to do this is to use your issue tracking system to create tickets for questions and manage accountability as with any other task.\n _linebreak_ Make decisions transparent and available. Teams on both sides of an offshore engagement will benefit from recording their conversations and making them available to the other team to go through when they come online. The story and context behind decision making is important for offshore team members to grasp, and apply correctly in their work.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 2. Meet and interact differently\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ If possible, set daily stand-up and stand-down meetings with the teams at the beginning and end of each work day. The goal of the meeting should be handover or alignment of work done and work to be done for that day. This should also be used as an opportunity to discuss and eliminate impediments.\n _linebreak_ If you can&rsquo;t find an overlap to hold joint stand-ups, you may have to rely on a fully asynchronous communication approach like email, persistent chat or recorded video/audio for operational activities.\n _linebreak_ Prepare to have late night or early morning demos. Real-time conversation is critical for your offshore team to get feedback and gauge sentiment.\n _linebreak_ Maintain a standby duty roster, where someone from the off-duty team will be available to field calls, escalations or matters of urgency on both sides if needed.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ Getting the right start\n _linebreak_Leaders on both sides of a remote engagement need to pay heightened attention in the initial weeks to ensure things are working well, and adapt away from things that aren't._linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 1. Actively solicit feedback in the early stages\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Ask for granular status reporting on projects. This will arm you with delivery performance data and help you to understand any underlying process or collaboration issues, as well as to inform your remedial actions more precisely. In addition to this, it will help to drive productive and spontaneous conversations between team members about process, culture and collaboration issues that are impeding delivery.\n _linebreak_ Keep your finger on the pulse of sentiment with tactical face-time. Set up check-in sessions with team-members on both sides of the engagement. This will allow you to understand how well your culture campaign is working, and will inform any cultural remediation actions that may be necessary.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 2. Lead with candid conversation\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Share progress and issues, threats and wins openly in the team. This will create alignment on delivery and culture issues between teams, team ambassadors and executive sponsors, especially in the early stages of each engagement. Don't be afraid to hold difficult conversations in an open-format. This approach will allow you to reach an optimum state quickly.\n _linebreak_ Create a safe space for honest and constructive conversation about what is working and what isn&rsquo;t for teams on both sides, by rewarding and encouraging those who do so publicly.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_ 3. Crystallise context\n_linebreak_Useful tools for maintaining transparency and alignment in offshoring engagements:\n _linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ A project canvas can be a valuable tool to keep the team aligned and build a common understanding of the project that they are endeavouring to deliver together. The goal of a project canvas exercise is for the execution team to clearly and collaboratively define the project goals, success criteria, milestones, stakeholders, constraints and risks. This, along with the business canvas becomes a living public document available for any team member to revisit and consider in their daily decision making process.\n _linebreak_ A business canvas is a tool for creating understanding about how your business works and can help drive better decision making in project teams. The goal of the business canvas is for the product owners or executive sponsors to introduce the execution team to the fundamentals of their business - revenue streams, customer segments, value proposition, objectives, partners and sales channels. This context creates an affinity and common-understanding of the business dynamics outside of the immediate project.\n _linebreak_ A team charter is a document that describes core principles for how teams interact and work with each other, and can be useful for driving collaboration and the goals of the work that is underway. Team charters are public assets that can be displayed on walls, desks at home and in the office, or virtual backgrounds. They are most effective when created collaboratively with all team members on both sides of the engagement.\n _linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_  \n _linebreak__linebreak_&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:49,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://eolstoragewe.blob.core.windows.net/wm-698609-cmsimages/Entelect-Offshoring-SouthAfrica.pdf&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:130}{&quot;1&quot;:8388,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://projectcanvas.entelect.co.za/&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:8402}">

Assign team ambassadors<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Make the one-team mindset somebody's core responsibility, on both sides.<br />_linebreak_ Relationship building activities are the bedrock of trust, respect and a highly collaborative work environment.<br />_linebreak_ This is a full-time job that requires two willing parties to own the following responsibilities:_linebreak_ _linebreak_ To own and manage the delivery and expectations on both sides.<br />_linebreak_ To act as ambassadors for their teams and people to the other side, to ensure that cross-border trust, alignment and affinity is cared for throughout the engagement.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak_<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 3. Encourage many-to-many relationships<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Let problem-solvers on both sides talk directly with those who can help on the other side. Don&rsquo;t let hierarchy or process prevent people from building natural, synchronous and useful relationships that help them get their work done.<br />_linebreak_ Allow for communication to flow openly between team members across shores and avoid strict communication protocols that filter everything through a single person.<br />_linebreak_ Make sure the teams understand what communication tools are available to them, and when they are appropriate.<br />_linebreak_ Prioritise face-time between teams regularly. This requires sacrifices on both sides due to time-zone differences and busy calendars, but it is necessary to maintain alignment and to prevent drifting expectations.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 4. Be explicit in your ways of working<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Standards, processes and tools need to be discussed and agreed upon clearly by everyone using them.<br />_linebreak_ If this mindset is shared by your onshore and offshore teams, you generate buy-in, compliance, and eliminate misunderstanding.<br />_linebreak_ A singular team, means a singular method of operation unless otherwise prescribed.<br />_linebreak_ At the start of a new offshoring engagement, expect to take a bit of pain to onboard a new delivery team into your ways of working.<br />_linebreak_ Spend time defining, sharing and campaigning for your ways of working on an ongoing basis. This can be driven by the team-ambassadors on both sides.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ Design workflow for asynchronicity<br />_linebreak_Operating software teams remotely and across conflicting time zones requires us to adapt our delivery processes and commit time differently to getting it right in an asynchronous setup._linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 1. Plan and deliver differently<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ You cannot make decisions as quickly or easily as when you have everyone co-located in the same time zone. That does not mean that you cannot be agile and change direction, it means you just need more discipline to adhere to your sprint plan.<br />_linebreak_ Plan features so that dependencies are minimised where possible. Alternatively, you can do this by creating modularised work packages that can be tackled independently.<br />_linebreak_ Turnaround times on questions can be a major obstacle, and so you need to manage technical questions and resolution as a matter of process. A useful way to do this is to use your issue tracking system to create tickets for questions and manage accountability as with any other task.<br />_linebreak_ Make decisions transparent and available. Teams on both sides of an offshore engagement will benefit from recording their conversations and making them available to the other team to go through when they come online. The story and context behind decision making is important for offshore team members to grasp, and apply correctly in their work.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 2. Meet and interact differently<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ If possible, set daily stand-up and stand-down meetings with the teams at the beginning and end of each work day. The goal of the meeting should be handover or alignment of work done and work to be done for that day. This should also be used as an opportunity to discuss and eliminate impediments.<br />_linebreak_ If you can&rsquo;t find an overlap to hold joint stand-ups, you may have to rely on a fully asynchronous communication approach like email, persistent chat or recorded video/audio for operational activities.<br />_linebreak_ Prepare to have late night or early morning demos. Real-time conversation is critical for your offshore team to get feedback and gauge sentiment.<br />_linebreak_ Maintain a standby duty roster, where someone from the off-duty team will be available to field calls, escalations or matters of urgency on both sides if needed.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ Getting the right start<br />_linebreak_Leaders on both sides of a remote engagement need to pay heightened attention in the initial weeks to ensure things are working well, and adapt away from things that aren't._linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 1. Actively solicit feedback in the early stages<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Ask for granular status reporting on projects. This will arm you with delivery performance data and help you to understand any underlying process or collaboration issues, as well as to inform your remedial actions more precisely. In addition to this, it will help to drive productive and spontaneous conversations between team members about process, culture and collaboration issues that are impeding delivery.<br />_linebreak_ Keep your finger on the pulse of sentiment with tactical face-time. Set up check-in sessions with team-members on both sides of the engagement. This will allow you to understand how well your culture campaign is working, and will inform any cultural remediation actions that may be necessary.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 2. Lead with candid conversation<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ Share progress and issues, threats and wins openly in the team. This will create alignment on delivery and culture issues between teams, team ambassadors and executive sponsors, especially in the early stages of each engagement. Don't be afraid to hold difficult conversations in an open-format. This approach will allow you to reach an optimum state quickly.<br />_linebreak_ Create a safe space for honest and constructive conversation about what is working and what isn&rsquo;t for teams on both sides, by rewarding and encouraging those who do so publicly.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_ 3. Crystallise context<br />_linebreak_Useful tools for maintaining transparency and alignment in offshoring engagements:<br />_linebreak__linebreak_ _linebreak_ A project canvas can be a valuable tool to keep the team aligned and build a common understanding of the project that they are endeavouring to deliver together. The goal of a project canvas exercise is for the execution team to clearly and collaboratively define the project goals, success criteria, milestones, stakeholders, constraints and risks. This, along with the business canvas becomes a living public document available for any team member to revisit and consider in their daily decision making process.<br />_linebreak_ A business canvas is a tool for creating understanding about how your business works and can help drive better decision making in project teams. The goal of the business canvas is for the product owners or executive sponsors to introduce the execution team to the fundamentals of their business - revenue streams, customer segments, value proposition, objectives, partners and sales channels. This context creates an affinity and common-understanding of the business dynamics outside of the immediate project.<br />_linebreak_ A team charter is a document that describes core principles for how teams interact and work with each other, and can be useful for driving collaboration and the goals of the work that is underway. Team charters are public assets that can be displayed on walls, desks at home and in the office, or virtual backgrounds. They are most effective when created collaboratively with all team members on both sides of the engagement.<br />_linebreak_ _linebreak__linebreak_ <br />_linebreak__linebreak_</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Do due diligence on your potential partner \n\nNot doing a proper due diligence check on a potential business partner is probably the biggest mistake one can make. You&rsquo;re under pressure and the person you&rsquo;re dealing with seems impressive and knowledgeable, so you go for it &ndash; only to find down the line that deadlines have been missed because of all sorts of issues and excuses, despite your partner having the best intent at the project outset. \n\nChoosing the right partner should not be done hastily. Meet the directors of the company and do your homework on them; check for judgements, get SARS clearance certificates, phone clients for references and physically visit the company&rsquo;s premises and meet key staff. Ascertain if the company has the appropriate support structures, ensure there is a culture-fit with your organisation and, most importantly, review CV&rsquo;s and meet the people who will be working on your project. Understand how the potential partner manages projects similar to yours &ndash; ask for evidence or get expert consultants to conduct appropriate audits if need be. It is also important to ensure that the company is in a strong enough financial position to carry the costs of default if contract milestones are not met. \n\nNote the quality of the proposal\n\nMake sure that the potential partner writes a high quality proposal, understands your requirements and has accurately presented them. The most senior staff are typically responsible for writing proposals, and the quality of the proposal will tell you a lot about the company and its people. Engage with the supplier in this process and ensure that they are on the same page as you.\n\nOwn the source code\n\nIf a software product can&rsquo;t be demonstrated, or is not demonstrably rolled out to a number of clients, you can safely assume that the vendor is designing and developing a custom built solution. Most corporate systems have a significant amount of custom requirements because, more often than not, systems are tailored around a business, not the other way around. \n\nUnless a solution is truly pre-packaged and supported, insist on owning the source code and ensure that this is stipulated in the terms of your agreement. Also ensure that appropriate technical documentation is delivered on handover, and that it is written in a way that it can be maintained by an alternative development team if need be. I have seen a number of companies being held over a barrel for exorbitant licence fees for a system that was developed exclusively for them, has been paid for in full, and then they still pay development fees for software upgrades that they don&rsquo;t own. Solutions that demand licence fees are typically highly commoditised with large footprints, such as accounting, relationship management, web management or online retail packages.\n\nMake sure you are charged a fair hourly rate\n\nIf you are using an independent contractor that has been supplied by a labour brokerage, then it is fair to add a 15% to 30% margin on the actual fee paid to the contractor, this fee is often negotiable. The recruitment agency typically needs to recover the costs of advertising, sourcing the candidate, negotiating contracts and paying salaries. Independent contractors demand higher hourly fees as the contract risk is on them. Bear in mind that bringing in &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; from agencies and having teams effectively under your management does have more risk associated with it as there is little recourse in the event of poor quality output.\n\nAlternatively, if you engage with a software vendor as a supplier, a premium can be charged with the proviso that more value will be delivered than just a team of contractors. The best form of engagement in our experience is for the vendor to take ownership of the delivery of a project. In this instance, ensure that the vendor has all the right credentials, supporting infrastructure, design processes, technologies and, most importantly, academically qualified software engineers or computer scientists. Would you hire an unqualified engineer to build and sign off a bridge? The same level of engineering professionalism should apply in the design and delivery of a piece of software &ndash; in particular if it is core to one&rsquo;s business. \n\nTo mitigate risks on a project I would recommend that the software vendor commits to a fixed price based on the delivery of specific milestones. For bigger systems, an initial &ldquo;paid for&rdquo; audit is usually conducted, with the outcome being milestone-based pricing, a project plan, functional specifications and an application level architecture design. The quality of this document can also serve as further security in the competence of the vendor before launching into a project.\n\nIs it cheaper or lower risk to hire your own software staff or to outsource?\n\nIf you perform the equation &ldquo;(time to delivery) times (hourly fees) over (quality as a percentage)&rdquo;, a good software outsource partner should come out at a lower number than if the project was performed by your in-house development staff. By quality I refer to a product that is easy to maintain, user friendly and bug free. \n\nOne large client of ours conducted an independent productivity audit on some of our teams and the results were quite staggeringly in our favour when compared to output levels of their in-house teams (after all why pay more when you can hire your own cheaper?). There are a number of reasons for this that are too lengthy to cover in this article, suffice to say that the output levels of a specialist design house will always be higher than one whose core business is something else. After all, would you go to the headache of sourcing, hiring and managing permanent staff to electrify and cable your expensive offices or would you use the services of a specialist electrical and cabling company? \n\nOver and above complete project outsourcing, we have had huge successes where we have taken over technical leadership and ownership of delivery of projects, often working side by side with existing in-house support teams &ndash; where often all that is required to speed delivery up is some specialist input and guidance. \n\nWhat is the make-up of a good software outsource team\n\nIn our experience, the best outsource projects work where the software vendor is given full ownership of design and delivery (assuming the right partner of course). Notwithstanding, a successful project requires a project champion on the client side to facilitate access to key business and technical people. In our experience, a typical outsource development team usually compromises a team lead who handles the client engagement, staff management and full life cycle of the project. The team lead must have strong prior development experience to lead effectively. A technical lead (or architect) needs to be involved during the initial design phases, while the rest of the team is usually made up of a senior software engineer who is a development environment specialist, followed by intermediate and junior level software engineers with proven problem solving ability and qualification. We have found, even with the best design process and methodology, the single most important factor in a software project is the quality of the people on the job, both from an attitude and problem-solving perspective. A good outsource partner should have a knack for consistently identifying, retaining and managing such people; otherwise it&rsquo;s a case of hit-and-miss.\n\nFinally, how is it possible to gauge if the software partner is doing a good job? \n\nIn our experience, the best way to ensure that a project is on track is to follow an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; approach, i.e., set lots of small targets and make sure that these are met and continually aligned with the project plan. Weekly progress report meetings are important because software projects are never exactly defined up-front and involve some iteration. Expecting a business owner to define a detailed specification in advance is not reasonable in a complex system, so a level of on-going refinement in the build phase is part of the process. We often create by seeing, so this level of flexibility must be allowed by the software partner.\n\nGetting the architectural basics right at the outset of a project is the most critical part of the project. If there is any doubt about a vendor&rsquo;s ability, it is at this time &ndash; before development work starts &ndash; that a technical audit should be done to see if the design is a good one. Building a system on a weak foundation that has not been designed with change in mind, is a recipe for disaster. A good software partner should understand where the system (and business) can potentially go and should cater for this at design time. After all, all large scale systems evolve just like a good business!&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;According to Matthew Butler, GM of Projects at Entelect, &ldquo;Technical debt reversal is definitely something we are starting to see more of with Chief Information Officers (CIO) and Development Managers. In our experience, technical debt remains one of our most challenging points of contention. Whether engaged in fully outsourced work, or more flexible resource or co-source engagements, technical debt is unavoidable.&rdquo;\n\nTechnical debt can be quite simply described as having two primary causes: poor code quality resulting in the systemic decay of the software&rsquo;s ability to perform as required or functional and system requirements flexing and shifting too far away from the original goals of the software&rsquo;s architecture, and again hampering its ability to support the new requirements adequately. It&rsquo;s clear that in cases where both have happened, the symptoms can be quite dire.\n\n&ldquo;We assist our clients with how to process this debt; which involves describing what it is and why it is there in the first place. Justifying the additional expense required to do any kind of work again is especially challenging in the South African context as budgets are often tight. In most cases, business may not understand the impact or risk of the debt and are often comfortable carrying it. Internally, with outsourced projects, the same exists, with the only difference being that we can more easily measure and manage it,&rdquo; says Butler.\n\nTechnical debt is very often seen to only affect legacy systems, or software that may need to integrate with them. This is a common misconception and it is important to recognise that technical debt is definitely not limited to these legacy systems. &ldquo;It not only affects newer and more modern systems but applies to systems still in development, and extends to our philosophy that every line of code written is a liability as soon as it is compiled. It&rsquo;s a scary thought, incurring technical debt on such a micro level, but not as bad as it sounds when you have the tools to understand and mitigate against it,&rdquo; adds Butler.\n\nThere are a number of solutions and methods for addressing technical debt. Firstly, along with the trend of awareness surrounding technical debt, the focus on tools to detect it and the improvement of the development environment has emerged as a principle area of focus. There are a number of tools that assist with static code analysis and package management which make life substantially easier.\n\nSecondly, process is key &ndash; especially development process. &ldquo;A considered approach to development, with either a fully agile methodology, or at least an appreciation for incremental and iterative delivery, is in our experience, by far the most effective. By taking your time to evaluate the situation, business rule conflicts are detected earlier and less pressure means code quality stabilises at the team&rsquo;s true capability. The central point here is that once the problem is well understood, the build itself is easy. With problems solved, emphasis can be put on future-proofing, and code quality as required,&rdquo; explains Butler.\n\nAnother effective option is to enable the business stakeholders to identify technical debt themselves. Awareness and understanding at that level goes a long way in reducing friction between business and IT, and makes for open communication and planning as a team.\n\n&ldquo;Testing is also a much advertised answer to this. Testing at all levels makes measurement of technical debt easier and provides a clear point-in-time picture of the health of the system. However, it only goes so far, and in our experience, technical debt is a hazard that is only visible with some amount of retrospect. In other words, you can&rsquo;t measure the debt before it is incurred,&rdquo; explains Butler.\n\n&ldquo;The last effective mitigation involves standards. Having a set of technical, process, tooling and technology standards is an important part of a healthy development team and also contributes positively to reducing technical debt. With the team being able to refer to both examples and standards, code quality improves and time is less impacted, which can then be spent on code- or architecture-reviews and more valuable feedback,&rdquo; concludes Butler.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Lately, it is hard to read an IT business magazine without encountering an article on how &lsquo;in-memory&rsquo; is going to change everything. While the recent developments around in-memory analytics and processing are indeed very promising, it is worth having a look at the underlying technologies, before jumping on the bandwagon. The discussions on in-memory often include one or more of the following:\n\nBig data\nFlash memory\nIn-memory analytics\nIn-memory transactional processing. \n\nBig data\n\n&lsquo;Big data&rsquo; is itself a buzzword. 5GB of relational banking transactional data a week is not big data but on the other hand, CERN&rsquo;s Large Hadron Collider&rsquo;s experimental results, at 6GB/second, are much more in the big data category. At its core, big data refers to data that is too large, too fast and/or too varied to be processed with traditional data-processing methods. It is not just about size, big data implies that there is a lot of data, that it is accumulating quickly and that it is unstructured. While big data may be processed using in-memory techniques, as a result of the size of the data involved, it is not likely to be stored in memory. Aggregations may be stored in memory, temporarily or permanently, but not the data itself.\n\nFlash memory\n\nWhen talking about in-memory, it is important to distinguish what kind of memory is being spoken of. Flash memory is a high-speed, non-volatile storage technology. It is what is used in Solid State Hard Drives (SSDs). While significantly faster than traditional magnetic media, flash memory is still a storage technology. However, it can be used to extend a server&rsquo;s main memory as in the case of SQL Server 2014&rsquo;s Buffer Pool Extensions. Generally, flash memory is used to reduce or remove the IO latency from applications that store and retrieve large amounts of data, like relational database engines. Since flash storage in the form of SSDs appear as regular drives, the applications using them need no special code or changes to handle them.\n\nIn-memory analytics \n\nIn-memory analytics allows for very fast querying and analysis of data. It encompasses applications such as Tableau and the PowerPivot plugin for Microsoft&rsquo;s Excel. In-memory analytics will often store data in columnar format, as opposed to the traditional row-based storage seen in relational databases. Columnar storage enables a very high compression rate, allowing for high speed analytics. The high compression means that large data sets can be worked on in-memory. Typically, the data is stored on durable storage and processed in-memory.\n\nIn-memory transactional processing\n\nWith in-memory OLTP engines, the data is stored in volatile memory and persisted at intervals to durable storage (flash memory or traditional magnetic drives). In-memory OLTP allows for extremely fast transactional processing, making it suitable for applications that need very high insert rates and to execute huge numbers of small transactions. Examples of this are stock market trading, telephone exchanges and on-line stores. Solutions in this area include the Hekaton feature in Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (renamed as In-memory OLTP) and Oracle&rsquo;s TimesTen In-Memory Database engine.\n\nRight solution in the right place \n\nWhichever form of in-memory solution is being considered, it is critically important that it not be implemented as a &lsquo;solution looking for a problem&rsquo;. The problems the various in-memory solutions solve are very different from one another. There is no gain from deploying in-memory solutions for the sake of doing so. Any solution must be carefully considered in the light of what problem it is expected to solve and what gains it is expected to give. Like with most areas of technology, there is unfortunately no magic solution for all problems to be found here.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Failed engagements can be costly in terms of effort, time and, of course, money. Meaningful relationships, on the other hand, can save you all three of these but they require commitment from both sides. Following these steps will ensure that you start these engagements on the right foot.\n \n1. Find the right partner \nIdentifying the right partner is an exercise that can cause an organisation to reflect on its own culture and objectives. Identifying a partner whose values align with your own company&rsquo;s is important because the individuals who embrace those values, will be an integral part of your project teams.\n\nTo determine which service provider is best suited to your company&rsquo;s goals, there are a few questions you need to ask to determine how serious the provider is about its staff and approach:  How strong is the company culture and identity?\n Does the provider performance-manage its staff in a structured and meaningful way?\n How does the supplier drive positive behaviour in its organisation?\n What kind of continuous-improvement and career-development processes does the provider have in place for its staff?\n Does the provider have technical expertise on your technology platform and implementing the type of solution that you are expected to deliver?\n Does the provider have a strong track record of delivery with companies similar to yours?\n What other services and value-adds does the company provide?\n  \nThe answers to these questions should inform your decision on partnerships. Without well-thought-out programmes covering these areas, your provider could end up being nothing more than a labour broker. Companies whose core function it is to connect talent with end-users are more likely to let borderline candidates slip through the process in order to meet your demand. More importantly, they may not be able to effectively solve software-development environment challenges. There is generally a very weak retention rate at these companies and a poor, or even absent, sense of employee engagement. This means that their HR challenges become your HR challenges and their churn becomes your churn. With large-scale offshore companies, this problem is further exacerbated by visa and immigration issues, sometimes poor technical quality as well as communication and cultural barriers.\n\nThere are some software-development companies that have a well-defined company culture and a comprehensive collection of experience that comes from managing large-scale software projects across multiple industries. Forging a strong partnership with an experienced software company will allow you to leverage a deep technical skill set as well as a dynamic collection of experience, distilled from years of working with peers and competitors. Whether it is effective knowledge-sharing through collaborative techniques, formal training programmes or implementing DevOps, these suppliers can guide you through the process and will be incentivised to do so if the relationship is meaningful to both parties. At Entelect, we often find that clients who recognise the value of our relationship and leverage our experience often gain the benefits of a more flexible model, optimised rates and an implicit advisory relationship.\n\nThe size of the company can play an important role, too. Larger service providers have a focus on scale and aggressive growth. The upside of such providers is that they can offer scale where smaller companies cannot. This can, at some levels, lead to an &lsquo;anyone-goes&rsquo; approach because the scramble to assemble teams at scale can pose a challenge. However, the strategy is usually to compensate for the weaker individuals on the team by placing strong, experienced team leaders and development managers to pick up the slack and act as quality gatekeepers on the project. Smaller companies usually place a greater emphasis on growing cautiously with the right fit of individual and technical skill set because their ability to take on risk is limited. These companies will also have different priorities. As a growing, young company, the focus will be on maturing internal processes, building a company brand and identity and delivering on a smaller number of key accounts.\n\n2. Begin with the intention of partnering\nOne thing is certain: you will be competing for priority regardless of the service provider you choose. It is always a good idea start your discussions by making it clear that you are interested in forging a partnership that will be mutually beneficial to both companies. If the provider is not the right partner, this will become clear with time. It is perfectly acceptable to start with a thin initial commitment as long as there is an understanding that there is a partnership on the line at the end of that contract.\n\nMost software development companies have the challenge of demand outstripping supply and they have to prioritise their resources across multiple clients while balancing their commitments to their clients and to their business. This means that they need to be sure that they are making the best decision for sustainable business in terms of where to invest their efforts and resources. When clients are looking for short-term, quick-win relationships, they are more unlikely to prioritise the requirement.\n\nA successful partnership requires transparency on both sides, and your partner should be held accountable for its performance. Things do not always go to plan in these partnerships and providers do not always get it right &ndash; having a partner who is willing to recognise failure and take meaningful remediation steps quickly will be a great asset to you. Whether it is having a dedicated account manager who is always available to take your call, or a direct line to a senior manager, having access to swift and flexible remediation options will help you to deal effectively with turbulence and to hold your partners accountable.\n\n 3. Deploy careful negotiation tactics\nNegotiating engagement terms and rates is healthy and a great way to manage the performance of your partnership. However, it is something that should be done carefully, and in such a way that takes into account the scale, potential and value of your current relationship. If priority and quality are your concern, you may want to hold off on aggressive negotiation tactics until your partnership has matured because this could have a very real and direct impact on prioritisation and the level of service that you receive. On the other hand, if you are not happy with your service provider, you can use aggressive negotiation tactics to motivate the provider to a better place of service. As a client procuring services, you have the unique ability to motivate and manage the performance of your provider through opportunity and negotiation. Using metrics such as market-related rates, opportunities, performance of individuals and service levels are all great inputs to the negotiation process.\n\n4. Provide a fast track through the red tape\nMost corporate IT divisions have internal screening processes that include a combination of online automated tests, assignments and interviews. The process can be complicated and protracted, and is a main reason why candidates take up offers at competitors or service providers. This can also be a turn-off for software development companies as it means spending more billable time pushing through red tape. More importantly, your screening process might focus on different strengths from your providers, which means that you may screen out potentially great candidates whom your provider highly recommends.\n\nIf you are comfortable with the level of service from your providers, it can be hugely beneficial to use a fast track through the red tape. Of course, your provider must first earn this privilege by proving a strong track record of providing high-calibre resources and services to you.\n\nAttributes such as strong problem solving, a solid foundation in computer science and object-oriented programming principles are important for software companies who operate across multiple technology platforms and industries. A corporate IT division that utilises specific frameworks may look for individuals with specialised experience on that platform or framework, and potentially screen out provider resources without adequate experience on that platform. There may be a differing ideology here that puts you and your provider at loggerheads &ndash; specialist versus generalist. Given that the provider has your interests in mind, it may be time to have that discussion with them in order to understand why they believe that generalist skills will work in your environment and to be on the same page with your approach. Being open to stretching your technology skills requirements might play to your advantage and allow you to build stronger teams, faster.\n\nResource availability can last anything from minutes to days in the software engineering world, but seldom weeks or months. A company&rsquo;s priority is to make firm commitments on its resources as quickly as possible and to minimise bench-time. This can often lead to a first-come first-served scenario. If you have been sent a proposal for a team of developers, try to turn it around as quickly as possible to secure the resources. If your provider is being slow and non-committal, do not hesitate to hold the company accountable for your deliveries &ndash; the provider has an obligation to enable your organisation.\n\n5. Own the relationship\nHR departments are great at facilitating the recruitment process for staff but they tend to be disruptive when dealing with specialist resource providers, such as software companies. In some cases, this comes down to a combination of poor relationship management (remember, they are dealing with a high volume of recruiters, candidates, clients and providers), lack of prioritisation (in certain circumstances they are providing HR and recruitment services for many business units) and a conflict of interest. The relationship with your provider needs to be managed carefully in order to maintain value and priority and to deal with issues or concerns effectively. If you are in a position to transform the way the HR works with strategic service providers, you will benefit by training them on the challenges you, as an IT department, face and the value of certain provider relationships. In this case, involving HR in the process and &lsquo;coaching&rsquo; them to facilitate the relationship may introduce a cultural change that could result in better provider management within your company. If you do not have a say in how services are procured or managed, a better approach is to maintain a direct channel with your service provider and be a buffer between the provider and HR.\n\n6. Integrate contractors into your team\nWhen the team is on the ground and it is a co-sourced mix (both permanent staff and contractors), your next challenge is to ensure that everyone operates as a single team, unified under the same vision and goal. Unfortunately, some leaders openly voice their objections regarding contract staff and this can be extremely damaging to your provider relationships, team dynamics and the contractors themselves. Understanding why contractors are a necessary asset to your company will help to maintain an integrated culture. Conversely, and equally important, is that your provider has a responsibility to ensure that its resources are technically capable and a good cultural fit for your organisation. This combined message and understanding will ensure that all parties involved are invested in your company&rsquo;s overall success.\n\nIn a market where talented software engineers are progressively scarce to come by and even harder to retain, software engineering partners can be an incredibly valuable asset to a corporate IT division. Recognising the importance of the elastic workforce, industry and technology agnostic expertise, and leveraging this through a mutually beneficial relationship can help give a new slick of paint to your IT culture, vision and ability to deliver on that mountain of project work in the pipeline. Investing some time in the relationships with your providers may be the most important thing you do in 2015.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Taking cybercrime seriously&quot;}">Taking cybercrime seriously</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;This figure is sure continue to rise in parallel to the continued rapid expansion of the Internet &ndash; the technological phenomenon which, although becoming available for commercial use just two decades ago, now plays an integral part in both our personal and professional lives.\n\nThe South African government&rsquo;s State Security Agency (SSA) has expressed growing concerns around Internet usage and the extent to which both private individuals and businesses have begun to rely on it. &lsquo;With Wi-Fi being implemented almost anywhere, being online is as important as running water and electricity nowadays,&rsquo; says Entelect&rsquo;s General Manager of Business Development, Mark Beets, &lsquo;More and more businesses have become fundamentally reliant on the Internet and connectivity in order to operate. The importance of maintaining the integrity of these systems, not only for their customers but alo for business continuity, has become one of the biggest challenges.&rsquo;\n\nWhile increasing mobility is celebrated for rapidly enhancing our daily lives and business processes, it is also creating more complex security threats. &lsquo;While many cybercriminals still practise the more &ldquo;small-time&rdquo; crime of hacking individual computers or devices, the masses of information now stored and run through cloud-based and connected servers have also seen a marked increase in cybercriminals attacking organisation infrastructure through online touch-points,&rsquo; Beets explains. &lsquo;This poses a substantial threat to any individual with personal or sensitive information stored digitally, across any number of devices, as well as to large businesses that have based their systems on digital platforms and infrastructure.&rsquo; The primary goals of cybercrime include theft, extortion and fraud, which all have potentially devastating consequences for victims.\n\nFurther increasing the risk to personal information is the continued growth of the Internet of things (IoT). &lsquo;With information constantly being sent and received by a massive number of sources, ranging from your office equipment and personal devices to your refrigerator at home and even your clothes, means that the amount of data being stored in the cloud by any individual is increasing exponentially. As a result, the risk of data breaches is increasing in parallel,&rsquo; explains Beets. &lsquo;Soon the use of Internet will be extremely difficult to avoid because the IoT is becoming the modus operandi of many companies and individuals for their day to day processes, and as such, education on data security is becoming more and more crucial.&rsquo; Vodacom&rsquo;s Chief Technology Security Officer, Vernon Fryer, has been quoted as saying that South Africa is the fourteenth most popular target for cybercriminals, with South Africans underestimating how at risk they are when sharing information and using the Internet.\n\nAmong a variety of troublesome trends, which were flagged in the CISCO 2014 Annual Security Report, Android mobile devices bore the brunt of 99 per cent of all mobile malware (malicious software). Furthermore, the report indicated a shortage of more than one million security professionals across the globe in 2014. &lsquo;Most organisations at the moment do not have the required systems or skills to be able to monitor networks and detect infiltrations, and then apply protections in a timely and effective manner,&rsquo; Beets continues.\n\nAccording to Beets, software organisations can play an important role because they have the ability to empower their clients and educate them regarding the potential risks to their businesses. &lsquo;A proper understanding creates the opportunity to proactively take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from cybercrime, which is vital to the survival of most modern businesses and the protection of their sensitive or personal information.&rsquo;\n\nBased on the most notorious cybercrimes, Beets offers the following advice to companies and individuals:\n\nBeware of unrecognisable links: do not click on these links when they are sent to you. This is a tactic used by hackers called phishing. Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to get individuals to reveal personal information online. These emails could be spam and expose you to fraudulent activity. Your systems can also be infiltrated by hackers when you download content from unknown sites, which can be triggered automatically by clicking on these suspicious links.\n\nUpdate your passwords regularly: up to three times per month. This is crucial to ensure your online information is secured at all times. Do not use birth dates, graduation years, or your mother&rsquo;s maiden name as security answers to access your online accounts &ndash; this makes a hacker&rsquo;s job even easier. By generating strong passwords you can make it much harder for hackers to break into your computer via the back-end code of the system.\n\nUnderstand that identity theft is real: identity theft has become increasingly common and is something everyone needs to worry about. Identity theft is when a criminal accesses data about a person&rsquo;s bank accounts and bank cards, social security and other sensitive information, to siphon money, engage in contracts or to make purchases in the victim&rsquo;s name. Always logout of your accounts properly &ndash; this is a good policy to protect yourself against identity theft and cyberfraud, which is the distribution of rogue security software to conduct fraudulent transactions.\n\nProtect against malware: malware is Internet-based software or programs that are used to disrupt a network and steal sensitive data, often causing damage to software present in the system. Malware can be installed in a variety of forms, from Trojan horses and spyware to viruses and worms. Investing in reputable security, firewall and anti-virus systems is crucial, and even with these in place, it is advised that you make use of public wireless internet providers sparingly. These Wi-Fi networks that are available in airports, coffee shops and hotels often do not require encryption of data traveling between laptops and the Internet. This means that all your information is unsecured to hackers.\n\nAvoid sharing devices with others: if you must and want your personal information to be undetectable by the person with whom you are sharing, you can browse incognito through the use of Google Chrome. By using Chrome, your browsing history and cookies will not show up in the history stored on device programmes. However, incognito mode does not hide your IP address, which means that your location, browser, operating system, as well as your own address, are not hidden by using this mode.\n\nScramble your information: one way to do this is to make use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs allow users to make sure that all information that passes between your device and the network is subjected to extreme encryption, making data safer.\n\n&lsquo;While we are aware of a certain number of cybercrimes, hackers develop new techniques constantly to trick you into unwittingly sharing your personal information,&rsquo; warns Beets, &lsquo;Knowing how to protect yourself can significantly add value and safety to your life online.

<div><a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2015/05/27/A-hacker-is-on-the-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This figure is sure continue to rise in parallel to the continued rapid expansion of the Internet &ndash; the technological phenomenon which, although becoming available for commercial use just two decades ago, now plays an integral part in both our personal and professional lives.<br /><br />The South African government&rsquo;s State Security Agency (SSA) has expressed growing concerns around Internet usage and the extent to which both private individuals and businesses have begun to rely on it. &lsquo;With Wi-Fi being implemented almost anywhere, being online is as important as running water and electricity nowadays,&rsquo; says Entelect&rsquo;s General Manager of Business Development, Mark Beets, &lsquo;More and more businesses have become fundamentally reliant on the Internet and connectivity in order to operate. The importance of maintaining the integrity of these systems, not only for their customers but alo for business continuity, has become one of the biggest challenges.&rsquo;<br /><br />While increasing mobility is celebrated for rapidly enhancing our daily lives and business processes, it is also creating more complex security threats. &lsquo;While many cybercriminals still practise the more &ldquo;small-time&rdquo; crime of hacking individual computers or devices, the masses of information now stored and run through cloud-based and connected servers have also seen a marked increase in cybercriminals attacking organisation infrastructure through online touch-points,&rsquo; Beets explains. &lsquo;This poses a substantial threat to any individual with personal or sensitive information stored digitally, across any number of devices, as well as to large businesses that have based their systems on digital platforms and infrastructure.&rsquo; The primary goals of cybercrime include theft, extortion and fraud, which all have potentially devastating consequences for victims.<br /><br />Further increasing the risk to personal information is the continued growth of the Internet of things (IoT). &lsquo;With information constantly being sent and received by a massive number of sources, ranging from your office equipment and personal devices to your refrigerator at home and even your clothes, means that the amount of data being stored in the cloud by any individual is increasing exponentially. As a result, the risk of data breaches is increasing in parallel,&rsquo; explains Beets. &lsquo;Soon the use of Internet will be extremely difficult to avoid because the IoT is becoming the modus operandi of many companies and individuals for their day to day processes, and as such, education on data security is becoming more and more crucial.&rsquo; </a><a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2015/05/27/A-hacker-is-on-the-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodacom&rsquo;s Chief Technology Security Officer</a>, Vernon Fryer, has been quoted as saying that South Africa is the fourteenth most popular target for cybercriminals, with South Africans underestimating how at risk they are when sharing information and using the Internet.<br /><br />Among a variety of troublesome trends, which were flagged in the CISCO 2014 Annual Security Report, Android mobile devices bore the brunt of 99 per cent of all mobile malware (malicious software). Furthermore, the report indicated a shortage of more than one million security professionals across the globe in 2014. &lsquo;Most organisations at the moment do not have the required systems or skills to be able to monitor networks and detect infiltrations, and then apply protections in a timely and effective manner,&rsquo; Beets continues.<br /><br />According to Beets, software organisations can play an important role because they have the ability to empower their clients and educate them regarding the potential risks to their businesses. &lsquo;A proper understanding creates the opportunity to proactively take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from cybercrime, which is vital to the survival of most modern businesses and the protection of their sensitive or personal information.&rsquo;<br /><br />Based on the most notorious cybercrimes, Beets offers the following advice to companies and individuals:<br /><br />Beware of unrecognisable links: do not click on these links when they are sent to you. This is a tactic used by hackers called phishing. Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to get individuals to reveal personal information online. These emails could be spam and expose you to fraudulent activity. Your systems can also be infiltrated by hackers when you download content from unknown sites, which can be triggered automatically by clicking on these suspicious links.<br /><br />Update your passwords regularly: up to three times per month. This is crucial to ensure your online information is secured at all times. Do not use birth dates, graduation years, or your mother&rsquo;s maiden name as security answers to access your online accounts &ndash; this makes a hacker&rsquo;s job even easier. By generating strong passwords you can make it much harder for hackers to break into your computer via the back-end code of the system.<br /><br />Understand that identity theft is real: identity theft has become increasingly common and is something everyone needs to worry about.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;At Entelect it is apparent that awareness of the differences between these two concepts needs to be promoted, mainly because the mind-set and approach required for each are different, and using the wrong combination means guaranteed friction and/or an engagement failure that could have been avoided.\n\nIt is very important to note that software solutions do not need to be polarised into either the project or product category. Each solution or engagement falls into the spectrum somewhere between the &lsquo;quick and dirty&rsquo; project and the full-blown product. With this in mind, let&rsquo;s first look at some of generally understood differences, which most project managers or product owners will already know:  Audience: Projects will generally have a more specific, internal functionality set, tailored to a certain audience, such as one department or one customer. It is not a stretch to stereotype projects as customer-specific software. Products need to leverage broader functionality for often a larger and/or external audience.\n Delivery: A project typically needs to provide only a specific set of deliverables. Examples could include a workflow system customised to a business process, or a new online capture form for customer feedback. A product must provide a viable solution for ongoing business, which is likely to include preparation and planning for the product life cycle: growth, adaptation, enhancement and decline from the software development perspective. Good examples of this include Salesforce.com and the Uber mobile apps.\n Time: Projects should be time-limited while products generally have a roadmap, but only loosely defined timelines up front.\n Return: Projects will often have an indirect return on investment through efficiencies gained, load reduction on teams, reduced operational or staff requirements and so forth. Products typically need to have a direct return on investment in such a way that, over a period of time, the product generates direct revenue to pay for its own development and enhancement.\n Development: Projects are often outsourced as contained pieces of work. Products are not usually outsourced, especially not for core business IP or competency.\n  Added to this list, there are other important differences that are not as well understood and can at times be overlooked:  Users: Projects regularly have a focused feature set and a controlled set of users. Control in this case means you know specifically who the users are (often they might have no choice but to use the software as part of their work). At the very least, you can chat to them and get direct feedback. Software products often need a large user base to be successful and this can impact many other decisions during the development process &ndash; we will see this influence coming through in the points below.\n Quality: As a consequence of a larger, and less-controlled user base, products need to prioritise quality. For any product, things such as first impressions, performance and user experience are critical for adoption and brand value. Another aspect is longevity. Code quality is crucial for products because should the product be successful in the marketplace, existing source code will need to be worked on for the foreseeable future. However, this is not to say that quality does not matter in a project, but it is less important.\n Technology: When developing a software project for a specific customer, generally technology choices are constrained to what tools and platforms are already in place. With product development, often the best and latest tools and technologies are needed to give the product the best chance it has in the marketplace.\n Architecture: There is an industry-wide buzz around building &lsquo;software as a service&rsquo; (SaaS) systems. Although the topic is beyond the scope of this article, the point is that architecture must suit the intended usage of the solution. Large products will require broad, and sometimes complex, infrastructure to allow for things such as multi-tenants, data partitioning, high availability, elastic resources and shared caching. Projects tend to be more predictable.\n Adaptability: Software products (think Microsoft Office or Eclipse IDE) have demands from multiple customers, so they need to adapt to varying customer requirements both now and in the future. This requirement is far more muted for projects.\n Testing: With a project, &lsquo;just good enough&rsquo; will more often than not suffice for the intended purpose. However, as a consequence of the user base, products require the accommodation of more hardware and software configurations.\n Investment: It is probably clear now from the differences tabled so far that building custom software products is expensive. More time is required for planning and executing a good software product solution that caters for the variability, quality, testing, user breadth, and the other product features mentioned, and time is the key cost factor for software development.\n  At Entelect, we like to use a set of questions to help stimulate the thought process to guide the project/product owner to an understanding of where on the spectrum their solution lies:  Is it for your company (internal system), or is it for users whom you would consider customers?\n Do you want to make a direct income from the solution?\n At the moment, are there any users of the system that you do not yet know of?\n Is there a market demand for your system &ndash; would anybody else want to use it? If so, would you expect them to use it as-is or would you need to tailor it?\n Does the solution represent a &lsquo;core competency&rsquo; &ndash; would this software solution be the key revenue driver for the business?\n Does the system need to be highly adaptable?\n  If you are answering &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to these questions, it means the solution leans more to the product side and answering &lsquo;no&rsquo; pushes it more to the project side. This really is a key point to establish as early as possible in process. With this positioning known, the next steps will feel more natural for the topics above. You can proceed with more confidence with your technology roadmaps, scoping, test planning, competitor analysis, project vision, architecting and budgeting.\n\nSuccessful projects and products start with positioning the solution or idea on the project-product spectrum and then tackling all of the topics raised (particularly approach, budget and timelines) in a way that is tailored to that position. Ultimately, when building software, and especially when looking to outsource, knowing whether you are building a project or a product is a great head start for setting expectations, vision and driving decisions.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Cybersecurity remains a huge issue throughout the world and South Africa is no exception. Currently, the South African government in the process of passing new legislation &ndash; the Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill. The new bill will allow it to define the offences for such attacks, with the list of offences being drastically expanded, and the fines for existing infringements being increased. This goes hand in hand with ensuring that electronic service providers carry out certain obligations relating to and impacting cybersecurity. In addition to this, the president is adding legislation that will allow him to collaborate with foreign states in order to combat cybercrime in an official capacity.\n  \n For a long time, the United Kingdom has striven to be one of the safest destinations to do online business. The country&rsquo;s vision for 2015 was to tackle cybercrime head-on, be more impervious to cyber attacks and to create an open, unwavering and pulsating cyberspace that the public could use without fear, a cyberspace that supports open societies. To this end, the United Kingdom had to have the know-how in terms of the latest skills, knowledge and capabilities in order to meet its cybersecurity objectives. It also meant:\n  \n  The public has had to know how to protect itself online\n Businesses in the United Kingdom have had to be up to date on how to fight cybercrime and have done this by working with their government and using its strengths to do this. This has encouraged businesses to operate securely in cyberspace\n The United Kingdom&rsquo;s government has had to improve its law enforcement response to cybercrime, its defences and infrastructure to detect and combat cybercrime, as well as education and skills\n The United Kingdom&rsquo;s government has had to help its country to take opportunities to provide the cybersecurity services that is needed across the world. These have allowed the country to build relationships with other countries, organisations and business around the globe in order to create an open and bustling cyberspace.\n   \n  \n In response to this new draft bill, South Africa has already started collaborating with United Kingdom and the European Council on Cybercrime to achieve the following:\n  \n  \n  A Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in case of a terrorist attack on critical governmental information infrastructures &ndash; the United Kingdom has the experience and has made it its mission to assist other countries with all issues relating to cybersecurity\n A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is being written for the cybercrime labs in cooperation with the European Council on Cybercrime.\n   \n  \n Thus, based on this collaboration in cybersecurity and governance, best practices and policy goals with the United Kingdom and the European Council on Cybercrime, South Africa&rsquo;s new Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill was drafted. In response to this, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is also gearing itself towards this bill by sending its state attorneys and advocates on NQF6 and NQF8 Cybercrime courses.\n  \n  \n As it stands, many security experts have cautiously welcomed the new bill, stating concerns that privacy and constitutional rights may be infringed upon. Leading cybercrime expert, Professor Basie von Solms, states it is still &ldquo;a step in the right direction,&rdquo; even though &ldquo;there were issues that had to be addressed.&rdquo;\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that in order to fight cybercrime and stay current in all matters relating to cybersecurity, South Africa will have to partner with other countries, businesses, organisations and most important of all, local ICT companies.\n  \n  \n As software engineers, we must work with government in order to guide it on all the technical aspects of cybercrime and cybersecurity in order to help them to understand and implement the correct legislation by considering the moral, ethical and legal aspects relating to IT. It is the duty and responsibility of the private sector to comment on laws that apply directly to it. After all, what is the point of the new legislation if there is no one to enforce it, and no one from the IT sector to assist government in implementing it?&quot;}">

It also meant:<br /><br />The public has had to know how to protect itself online<br />Businesses in the United Kingdom have had to be up to date on how to fight cybercrime and have done this by working with their government and using its strengths to do this. This has encouraged businesses to operate securely in cyberspace<br />The United Kingdom&rsquo;s government has had to improve its law enforcement response to cybercrime, its defences and infrastructure to detect and combat cybercrime, as well as education and skills<br />The United Kingdom&rsquo;s government has had to help its country to take opportunities to provide the cybersecurity services that is needed across the world. These have allowed the country to build relationships with other countries, organisations and business around the globe in order to create an open and bustling cyberspace.<br /><br /><br />In response to this new draft bill, South Africa has already started collaborating with United Kingdom and the European Council on Cybercrime to achieve the following:<br /><br /><br />A Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in case of a terrorist attack on critical governmental information infrastructures &ndash; the United Kingdom has the experience and has made it its mission to assist other countries with all issues relating to cybersecurity<br />A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is being written for the cybercrime labs in cooperation with the European Council on Cybercrime.<br /><br /><br />Thus, based on this collaboration in cybersecurity and governance, best practices and policy goals with the United Kingdom and the European Council on Cybercrime, South Africa&rsquo;s new Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill was drafted. In response to this, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is also gearing itself towards this bill by sending its state attorneys and advocates on NQF6 and NQF8 Cybercrime courses.<br /><br /><br />As it stands, many security experts have cautiously welcomed the new bill, stating concerns that privacy and constitutional rights may be infringed upon. Leading cybercrime expert, Professor Basie von Solms, states it is still &ldquo;a step in the right direction,&rdquo; even though &ldquo;there were issues that had to be addressed.&rdquo;<br /><br />It has become increasingly clear that in order to fight cybercrime and stay current in all matters relating to cybersecurity, South Africa will have to partner with other countries, businesses, organisations and most important of all, local ICT companies.<br /><br /><br />As software engineers, we must work with government in order to guide it on all the technical aspects of cybercrime and cybersecurity in order to help them to understand and implement the correct legislation by considering the moral, ethical and legal aspects relating to IT. It is the duty and responsibility of the private sector to comment on laws that apply directly to it. After all, what is the point of the new legislation if there is no one to enforce it, and no one from the IT sector to assist government in implementing it?</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;There are two aspects to analytics: technical and capabilities. Firstly, you need to be able to get the data and visualise it &ndash; this is the technical side of analytics. You then need to know what to look for &ndash; this is the capabilities aspect.\n Before we can understand the capabilities side of analytics, we need to grasp the technical aspect. Today, there is a whole host of Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) available to the general public, including EDX, Corsera and BigDataUniversity. These MOOCs provide a wide variety of free and paid-for courses that can assist people in developing their talent and enabling them to reach their analytics capability. Another option is to pick up some technologies and give them a try. Most new technologies for data analytics are very intuitive and do not require a massive amount of technical ability to get out a proof of concept. For example, NodeXL is a great Excel plugin that you can use to quickly get out social media statistics, while Tableau and Qliksense both provide a useful desktop platform to connect to data sources and quickly create a data discovery dashboard. IBM&rsquo;s Watson is also an option. If you want a lightweight cloud version that you can throw some data at and get some great insights, it is quite affordable.\n So who do we hire in the new world of analytics? The technologies we are using are far too young for someone to be an expert in them. When I&rsquo;m hiring people for a relatively new technology stack, I like to look at the person&rsquo;s online profile: does he or she have a blog that is respected within the community; has he or she published articles; what is his or her status on forums? In the interview, I try to gauge the applicant&rsquo;s passion for data and analytics. Because the technologies are so young, I look for a pseudo track record that will provide confidence in abilities and not necessarily a commercial track record.\n When you are looking to outsource certain components of your analytics strategy, use the same methodology for the service provider&rsquo;s staff. Public profile, transparent training programmes and track records are key when it comes to bleeding-edge technologies.\n In terms of developing people in the realm of analytics, not the technical side, there is no hard-and- fast method for this. My best advice is to read as many industry case studies as possible, keep up to date with global trends within your sector, and try to use some of this learning to apply internally. Many people outside of your organisation are investing a lot of money into these case studies and it&rsquo;s an easy win. I also try to read relevant research papers from Masters and PhD students from around the world.\n The one point I must stress is that locally relevant domain knowledge is crucial. Understanding the industry and business is a critical component to achieving analytics success. I have mentioned this before but I always look for the &lsquo;Miss Congenialities&rsquo; of organisations. These people have been at the company for many years, worked in several departments and are likely to have more domain knowledge than most. Always try to leverage these people when going down your analytics journey.\n From a capabilities point of view, there are two additional key points organisations need to take into account. Firstly, the relationships with external parties, which include vendors, suppliers and universities. These people are paid to keep up to date with industry trends, research what the next big thing is and are more than willing to share that knowledge. \nUniversities in particular are great channels for assisting with analytics capabilities because their research departments are on the cutting edge of what is coming next. They are also in need of corporate sponsorship. Many graduates are doing great work and are worth talking to about ideas you may have to take your organisation to the next level.\n The second point is to &lsquo;invest time in wasting time&rsquo;. This is one of the most important things you can do to keep yourself abreast of what is going on in the world of data analytics.

If an idea is deemed to be valuable, the centre of excellence hands this to the internal BI/MIS team, which then formalises the new analytics.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;In the world of building software, best practices are considered a field-proven technique for solving a known problem. They should be a guide. A mechanism that sets boundaries and establishes clear roles, process and measurements. As software professionals, we want these processes, practices and methodologies to tell us how to get big teams to work together effectively, how to measure (and report) progress and how to collectively deliver great quality software. This sounds right, however, best practices should not be used as a prescriptive, singular approach. At some point, every problem becomes unique and common sense offers additional value.\n  \n Voltaire famously said in 1764 that &ldquo;Common sense is not so common&rdquo;. This just indicates that we can&rsquo;t rely on common sense to make decisions as perspectives are not always shared. Instead, we should foster a shared understanding, a consensus on a position and perception which allows groups of people to reach the same conclusion.\n  \n Looking at the two concepts, there is a clear relationship. It seems that we go about creating and documenting practices in this endless desire to pen down common sense, to articulate things that we often feel are obvious with retrospect, the Agile revolution is a stand-out example of this. Perhaps the real goal is to know how to sequence and blend practices to service a specific software development scenario - a cocktail of experience, maturity, structure, influence and intent.\n  \n I&rsquo;m regularly confronted by frustrated software engineers who are baffled by the seeming absence of common sense being applied in their development environments. The frustration of engineers and development managers share an interesting degree of overlap. The developer is confused at either the lack or excess of process, and the development manager is frustrated at the lack of adoption of the processes, or the uncertainty of which process to use. Dealing with these situations takes some insight.\n  \n I like to think of best practices, or strict methodologies as a set of rules to get you going. First we need to learn and master these rules and their application, this is experience, thereafter we can experiment. An opinion with experience carries a lot more weight. People aren't naturally good at using common sense in complex and quickly developing areas, so it feels intuitive to start with a documented approach, and not rely on our own individual sense.\n  \n Intention is also important. Identify the actual objective of the practice. For example, a strict process that govern changes to a software product could feel encumbered and unnecessary, but the intention is to protect the company and the users, which makes sense. In this example my argument would be to first master the process, and prove beyond a doubt that you&rsquo;re capable of adhering to it, and then start a process of change from your position of proven knowledge.\n  \n With the application of experience and mastery, we can know when and how to break, or evolve, the rules to better suit the people, the product or the objectives. This is the &lsquo;common sense&rsquo; many will rush to claim prematurely.\n  \n Given this understanding, it stands to reason that industries current set of best practices are the combination of experience from experts who have come before us, but also that once we reach a level of experience and mastery, our own common sense can inspire adaptation.\n  \n  \n There is a Japanese martial arts concept called &lsquo;Shuhari&rsquo; which roughly translates to &ldquo;first learn, then detach, and finally transcend&rdquo; which is an enlightening approach to developing best practice that is relevant every time.\n  \n At Entelect we&rsquo;re constantly selecting, applying and measuring development practices to find what works. As engineers, processes are important to us and the development of rules helps streamline problem-solving to some degree. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we operate SCRUM by-the-book on every project. Every problem really is unique, mostly because of the people! Part of successfully applying best practice requires establishing a consensus on a position and perception between development managers and engineers. At which point, the team can &lsquo;learn, detach and transcend&rsquo; and the resulting application of common sense can add real value to best practice solutions.&quot;}">

Perhaps the real goal is to know how to sequence and blend practices to service a specific software development scenario - a cocktail of experience, maturity, structure, influence and intent.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m regularly confronted by frustrated software engineers who are baffled by the seeming absence of common sense being applied in their development environments. The frustration of engineers and development managers share an interesting degree of overlap. The developer is confused at either the lack or excess of process, and the development manager is frustrated at the lack of adoption of the processes, or the uncertainty of which process to use. Dealing with these situations takes some insight.<br /><br />I like to think of best practices, or strict methodologies as a set of rules to get you going. First we need to learn and master these rules and their application, this is experience, thereafter we can experiment. An opinion with experience carries a lot more weight. People aren't naturally good at using common sense in complex and quickly developing areas, so it feels intuitive to start with a documented approach, and not rely on our own individual sense.<br /><br />Intention is also important. Identify the actual objective of the practice. For example, a strict process that govern changes to a software product could feel encumbered and unnecessary, but the intention is to protect the company and the users, which makes sense. In this example my argument would be to first master the process, and prove beyond a doubt that you&rsquo;re capable of adhering to it, and then start a process of change from your position of proven knowledge.<br /><br />With the application of experience and mastery, we can know when and how to break, or evolve, the rules to better suit the people, the product or the objectives. This is the &lsquo;common sense&rsquo; many will rush to claim prematurely.<br /><br />Given this understanding, it stands to reason that industries current set of best practices are the combination of experience from experts who have come before us, but also that once we reach a level of experience and mastery, our own common sense can inspire adaptation.<br /><br /><br />There is a Japanese martial arts concept called &lsquo;Shuhari&rsquo; which roughly translates to &ldquo;first learn, then detach, and finally transcend&rdquo; which is an enlightening approach to developing best practice that is relevant every time.<br /><br />At Entelect we&rsquo;re constantly selecting, applying and measuring development practices to find what works. As engineers, processes are important to us and the development of rules helps streamline problem-solving to some degree. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we operate SCRUM by-the-book on every project. Every problem really is unique, mostly because of the people! Part of successfully applying best practice requires establishing a consensus on a position and perception between development managers and engineers. At which point, the team can &lsquo;learn, detach and transcend&rsquo; and the resulting application of common sense can add real value to best practice solutions.</div>

To build a perfect solution requires the engineer to do all these things in parallel, which is true craftsmanship and takes years of experience.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Globally, companies spend millions on formal Leadership Development initiatives to try and fast track and invest in their leadership pipeline. A typical Harvard Business School Executive Leadership Development Program can easily cost in excess of $40 000, with local programs being a bit more affordable, ranging from R60 000 for short courses to an excess of R300 000 for executive focused programmes.\n  \n Irrespective of the type of programme, they all have a common goal in mind: to develop the next set of leaders inside our organisations. However, we sometimes miss the mark by not delivering a good balance between targeted outcomes compared to the amount of time, effort and money put in.\n  \n In other words we are not getting the needed bang for our buck. But there are some common mistakes we make when starting these initiatives:\n 1) Failing to properly define expected ROI metrics and later benchmarking against them.\n 2) Failing to select the correct programme, course or service provider that fits the current needs, goals and culture of the organisation.\n 3) Not selecting the right attendees.\n  \n As we all know, there are no shortcuts to developing our staff, be it technical development or leadership development. What we need is a well thought through approach that will help us navigate the dynamic world of business.\n  \n Time, effort, commitment and follow through:\n Form a managerial level, we need to spend time and effort to take stock of what our organisational needs are. For example, do we prioritise technical skills over leadership skills? Do we get an external service provider to present new content or, do we develop our own?\n We need to commit to our training and development initiatives as part of a continual learning process. We do this by actively managing expectations and actual outcomes.\n Finally, we need follow through. We need to measure, assess and be able to illustrate the true impact the program has had, not only on the organisation as a whole, but specifically on the individual. That is ultimately our goal, improving the individual.\n  \n A framework:\n To help you structure your skills, and leadership development programmes it is worth thinking of it in terms of a hierarchy of needs. Different groups of employees have different needs, at different times of their careers, where each layer supports and builds up to the next layer.\n  \n A typical hierarchy of needs triangle can illustrate how you could structure some of your initiatives to achieve maximum impact. Each level targets a specific need or group in the business, and will be tailored accordingly.\n 1. Culture and Values: As a starting point the cultural elements as well as the core values of the organisation needs to be defined, communicated and regularly reinforced. One of the many functions of this layer is to set and communicate your commitment to caring for and growing your staff. Initiatives in this layer can be broader in focus and can be targeted to larger groups within the organisation.\n  \n 2. The Core Technical Competencies layer focusses on equipping your staff with the needed skills and knowledge to be able to effectively perform their duties. In other words, your staff needs to have the ability to perform per the expected standard of excellence. Training programs that fall into this layer, should have a direct impact on the daily operations of the business.\n  \n 3.The Technical Specialities layer focusses on the specialist skillsets that will help drive your business forward, ensuring that:\n It remains relevant in the market place in terms of technical capability (such as technology changes, competition, client demands).\n It can take on new opportunities that arise over time as result of a changing market conditions (such as emerging technologies, new markets).\n It can differentiate itself from its competitors (via niche or specialist skills)\n  \n 4. New Leadership Development focusses on developing new leaders and helping them transition from technical experts into leaders in your organisation. This is especially difficult to achieve, especially in strong technical environments where a lot of value and status is assigned to your technical and specialist ability as an individual. What is important to note, and incorporate, into initiatives for this layer is the differentiation between technical ability and leadership ability as distinct disciplines.\n Initiatives in this layer are less broad, and some specialisation needs to be done by identifying sub groups, such as inexperienced leaders vs experienced leaders.\n  \n 5. Targeted Leadership Development needs to ensure that you nurture and grow your key leaders in the organisation. What needs to be recognised is that just as you would mentor your staff on technical competencies, leaders need specific leadership focused mentorship in order to develop their leadership ability further.\n Research has shown that people who have been mentored by multiple mentors, have shown greater levels success than those who have only been mentored by a single mentor.\n Initiatives in this layer needs to be focused on the individual and tailored to their specific needs and situation. If they are group based, the groups must be smaller and individuals needs to be grouped according to their leadership development needs.\n  \n Ultimately, the outcomes and impact of training and development initiatives needs to be measurable and illustratable to be able to assess the value of the amount of time, effort and money put in. But similarly, the appropriate selection and &lsquo;fit&rsquo; of employees to each training course is important. You need to ensure that the initiative will cater to the needs of the specific group or person, and that the expected outcomes will match your goals for the organisation.\n  \n By applying our minds and defining a structured approach to how we implement our training leadership development initiatives we can start the journey of not only caring for, and growing our staff more effectively, but also delivering true value to the organisation without blowing the budget.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;In the world of software development, user experience (UX) design is a hot topic.\n Research has shown that UX design can significantly enhance the customer experience, by focusing design efforts on improving usability, accessibility and the user journey. In the age of mobile, the user&rsquo;s experience can have a huge impact on whether your app will be a success or failure: the difference between millions of downloads and none.\n I recently listened to a podcast about &lsquo;Hostile Architecture&rsquo; and started thinking about how we can employ this concept in shaping users&rsquo; behaviour; pushing them away from certain behaviours and towards others.\n Let&rsquo;s have a look at what is meant by &lsquo;Hostile Architecture&rsquo;, also known as &lsquo;unpleasant design&rsquo;. In architecture, unpleasant design has manifested itself in a wide variety of areas.\n Here are some common examples:\n  Using metal spikes or protrusions to prevent people from sitting or sleeping on sidewalks and in front of shop windows\n Designing seats in a way that prevents people from sitting comfortably for long periods, such as at bus and train stations\n At airports, arm rests are designed in a way that prevents people from lying down, forcing them to sit, straight up, knees facing forward &ndash; not the most comfortable position for a wary traveller!\n The use of pink lighting outside shops accentuates skin blemishes and therefore discourages teenagers from congregating outside\n The use of ultraviolet lighting under city bridges and in public restrooms makes it difficult for drug users to locate their veins to inject drugs\n  What&rsquo;s important to note is that, in all these examples, the core problem was not resolved, but rather shifted. It forced vagrants to find other places to sit or sleep, teenagers to find other spots to congregate at, that didn&rsquo;t highlight their, well, spots. Drug users were forced to find other places to get high.\n The point is that unpleasant design is meant to deter or frustrate the user to such an extent that the undesirable behaviour is either ceased or displaced.\n So how do we apply this to UX design?\n Typically, if you wanted to change your users&rsquo; behaviours, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t opt to frustrate them. You might argue that you would rather use an incentive model to elicit the desired behavioural change. However, there are a few examples where unpleasant design might come in handy, such as in fraud prevention and monitoring.\n As part of bigger enterprise-level systems, some activities are considered higher risk than others. For instance, users of a payments administration platform might be able to update or change a creditor&rsquo;s banking details. By manipulating these details, payments could potentially be funnelled away from the intended recipient into a fraudster&rsquo;s account. If details are changed back after a payment has been processed, and in the absence of proper control mechanisms, the fraud could go undetected.\n Let&rsquo;s assume that all the typical control mechanisms and processes are in place to prevent fraud but that there are functions on the system that are vulnerable to abuse.\n How do we design a system that highlights and actively discourages these high-risk actions?\n One approach could be to apply the concept of unpleasant design, with the purpose of deterring or frustrating the user to avoid certain undesirable or high-risk behaviours. For example, the high-risk behaviour on the system is highlighted by making the typical audit trail data visible to the users. By doing this, the user is made acutely aware of his actions and behaviour on the system, as well as the fact that this behaviour is being tracked and monitored. And so, you rely on the resulting psychological effect as the deterrent: the fear of being caught.\n Understanding your client and their business\n Software engineers need to constantly look for ideas and find inspiration from other environments and industries to help drive innovation and rejuvenate our way of thinking about how we design and build systems.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Agile is an approach that companies must be prepared to live, breathe and consistently practise to realise the full value of the methodology. This means full buy-in and in most instances, a mind-shift across the entire organisation. Add the rapid pace of industry caused by the Digital Age, it&rsquo;s easy to see why every organisation needs a software development workforce to stay up-to-date and competitive.\n  \n Traditional product development lifecycles just don&rsquo;t cut it anymore. These processes can delay a great idea by 12 months, meaning your organisation quickly loses its position against it competitors.\n  \n The Agile methodology was designed to help organisations respond more efficiently in a dynamic market environment. But there are critical success factors to Agile. If you don&rsquo;t adhere to these, then you&rsquo;re probably not seeing the benefits and wondering what all the fuss is about.\n  \n How to do Agile right?\n  \n 1. To do Agile &lsquo;right&rsquo;, requires the organisation to foster a culture of innovation. Agile creates a &lsquo;start-up&rsquo; vibe, which inspires employees. It is widely understood that a great idea can come from any facet of a business, and most certainly from any employee. Challenging the status quo is a characteristic that is at the heart of Agile. An organisation that encourages its employees to constantly challenge the status quo is going to inspire innovative thinking as part of its culture.\n  \n 2. The team structure is critical. It&rsquo;s the responsibility of the product owner in an Agile squad to ensure that the right people are in the right seat. A squad normally comprises of the following roles:\n &bull; Product owner\n &bull; Scrum master\n &bull; Technical lead\n &bull; Squad members (developers, designers, testers, data analysts and analysts)\n  \n The squad should then be supported by a scrum coach, engineering coach, and people coach. Coaches may seem like an unnecessary second layer but the coaches are essential. They are there to support, guide, and teach the tools and principles for successful Agile implementation. Without them, your squad will not have the benefit of previous experience.\n  \n 3. Provide plenty of training. The dynamic nature of Agile means that teams must be constantly learning, evolving and adapting. Teams need a vast array of skills and experience to deliver on an Agile project. It is important to equip the squad with the necessary skills and knowledge to make the correct calls.\n  \n  \n Why Agile goes wrong?\n  \n There are several reasons Agile in organisations fails before it gets going. Often it is the lack of simple but essential team features.\n  \n 1. Autonomy. The product owner doesn&rsquo;t allow or encourage autonomy in the squad. The squad must be encouraged to make decisions and consequently take ownership. Only when people feel a sense of ownership can they have the greatest impact on a project.\n  \n 2. The scrum master must sustain performance. When scrum masters don&rsquo;t drive performance, or demonstrate any creativity to improve team dynamics, communication breaks down and this ultimately breaks the quality and culture in the squad.\n  \n 3. Compiling a team with the wrong skills. In a bid to get an Agile team in place, corporates often compile a squad without the right complement of skills and expertise. The result is that the team falls back into its old habits.\n  \n 4. The product must be designed, spec&rsquo;d and estimated before it is passed to the Agile squad to build. Thereby fitting a waterfall project into an Agile development drive train, but not allowing Agile methodology to build the product as you go.\n  \n  \n  \n How to start Agile in a corporate?\n  \n A top-down approach is always the best place to start. No doubt that buy-in from executives and senior management really help to cement a new approach.\n  \n Hire smart. Ensure you have the correct people with the correct skills on the team. Importantly, make sure you have a Scrum master who can keep the team running on a solid, even, and efficient pace. This person must be the heartbeat of the team.\n  \n Start with a fresh project with minimal dependencies. This will allow you to experience the strength of doing Agile &lsquo;right&rsquo;, and doing it right first time will give you a solid base for your next Agile project.\n  \n Don&rsquo;t forget to look after your people. The environment, having the right tools for the job &ndash; and plenty of coffee - all play a big part. The team must be exceptionally cohesive.\n  \n Finally, be committed to the process.

Failure is a relative term, and can be varied in scope, intensity and consequence. Some projects run over resource or time constraints with marginal consequence, others fail miserably with disastrous consequences.\n  \n In 1999, NASA lost one of its $129-Million Mars Orbiters due to a seemingly obvious problem and mistake.

The result being that after its 286-day journey to Mars, the Orbiter initiated and engine burn to push itself into its final orbit around Mars. Due to the unit mismatch, it pushed the orbiter 25 km closer to the atmosphere than it should have. Subsequently things got worse, the engine overheated, turned itself off and ultimately the orbiter shot through the upper Mars atmosphere, popping out the other side, sending it outwards into space.

There is the obvious financial impact of failed projects, but most importantly there is a huge loss-of-opportunity cost. This can range from a basic loss of income caused by not being able to capitalize on your ideas or initiatives, to making bad business decisions by not having sufficient insight into your own business data. Bad decisions can cost you your business.\n  \n Failure\n  \n So, when things do go wrong and don&rsquo;t work out as expected; what then?\n  \n Well, depending of the severity of the failure, your first action might be to Google The Seven Stages of Grief (Shock, Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Testing, Acceptance). And then you realize that ironically a lack of Testing and Acceptance is probably what got you into this mess in the first place!\n  \n Then as the shock fades you turn your attention back to the task at hand. What now?\n  \n As a start, it is to be expected that your client will most probably be very angry and may need an outlet to vent their frustration. Don&rsquo;t see this as a negative aspect of the experience. The important point to note here is to listen and show the client that you care, not that you are just sympathetic, but that you are deeply empathetic as to what has transpired.\n  \n Own your mistakes\n  \n By building meaningful relationships with your clients, it will create room for experimentation and ultimately create tolerance for mistakes. It is important to own your mistakes and to never underestimate the value of saying you are sorry.\n  \n Consider all the information at hand before responding to your client&rsquo;s view point and frustrations. It is important to take stock and assess what when wrong. Most of the time it is not a single factor, but a series of factors and events that culminates into a crisis. It is important the translate this into a learning experience for both yourself, your team and even your client.\n  \n Never waste a good crisis\n  \n This will naturally lead you into a space where you can start the recovery process, for both yourself and your client. This is the stage where you start fighting your way back and winning back some of the trust that may have been lost. You need to research, plan, negotiate and work your way back. This is where you show what you are made of, you need to commit time, resources and potentially money to work towards your planned goals of recovery.\n  \n Some challenges along the way will include winning back enough trust from the client to allow you room to execute your recovery plan. You will need to keep your team motivated throughout, keeping them committed to the end goal.

For Discovery, this probably makes sense given the integrated nature of their products. Uber, on the other hand, provides an app for ride sharing and a separate app for food delivery, requiring the user to download both if they&rsquo;re wanting to order food whilst riding in an Uber from the airport to the hotel.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Beware of bolt-on digital transformations - the short-term thinking trap.\n  \n Digital transformation (DX) is the initiative every corporate talks about and spends vast resources on, it hardly needs to be mentioned at this point. With this level of investment, all these organisations should be well down the path of becoming digital right? A 2017 study done by Forrester Consulting for Microsoft has explored this topic in some depth and highlights that only the minority of enterprises have actually embraced digital transformation as it is envisioned; effectively stating that although there was a strategy (and it got priority), it&rsquo;s made little to no difference.\n  \n To begin, let&rsquo;s attempt to define what digital transformation is. The fundamental principle behind DX is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business. This alone is incomplete without the culture shift this change implies. A business needs to be agile in its approach to evolving, the bloat and inflexibility associated with corporates are widely considered one of the primary reasons DX is not implemented correctly.\n \nForrester Consulting coined the term &ldquo;Bolt-On&rdquo; digital transformation, which refers to enterprises that attempt to run digital initiatives as projects without actually realising the need to change the core organisational culture along with the integration of digital technology right across their businesses.\n  \n In South Africa there is no difference, this is an unfortunate reality across the majority of large organisations. It&rsquo;s not uncommon at all to see a fully thought out straight-through-process beautifully described, only to find an extremely labour intensive process propping the automated process up behind the scenes. This is a strong indication that digital initiatives are bolted-on as opposed to thinking about DX more strategically and looking for true transformation.\n  \n Two major culprits behind these bolt-on &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; strategies are cost-saving measures and an analogue culture. Leadership in enterprises is well aware of the benefits of digital transformation but have often proceeded without consideration for culture and the drivers mentioned. This results in them consistently battling to keep up with the smaller companies who are taking their market share.\n  \n Given the focus and investment in digital transformation across South African businesses, one can be optimistic that we&rsquo;re at least going in the right direction as a collective; we&rsquo;re tending towards a truly transformed industry. Our large companies are inherently slow to change due to the size, and that&rsquo;s before taking compliance into account.\n  \n Still, we must persevere or inevitably fail. So, while bolting-on some digital services, processes or products could offer short-term relief, statistics show clearly that it will stunt future potential. Instead, take the hard road to create and install digital culture in the minds and hearts right across the business.

<div>Beware of bolt-on digital transformations - the short-term thinking trap.<br /><br />Digital transformation (DX) is the initiative every corporate talks about and spends vast resources on, it hardly needs to be mentioned at this point. With this level of investment, all these organisations should be well down the path of becoming digital right? A 2017 study done by Forrester Consulting for Microsoft has explored this topic in some depth and highlights that only the minority of enterprises have actually embraced digital transformation as it is envisioned; effectively stating that although there was a strategy (and it got priority), it&rsquo;s made little to no difference.<br /><br />To begin, let&rsquo;s attempt to define what digital transformation is. The fundamental principle behind DX is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business. This alone is incomplete without the culture shift this change implies. A business needs to be agile in its approach to evolving, the bloat and inflexibility associated with corporates are widely considered one of the primary reasons DX is not implemented correctly.<br /><br />Forrester Consulting coined the term &ldquo;Bolt-On&rdquo; digital transformation, which refers to enterprises that attempt to run digital initiatives as projects without actually realising the need to change the core organisational culture along with the integration of digital technology right across their businesses.<br /><br />In South Africa there is no difference, this is an unfortunate reality across the majority of large organisations. It&rsquo;s not uncommon at all to see a fully thought out straight-through-process beautifully described, only to find an extremely labour intensive process propping the automated process up behind the scenes. This is a strong indication that digital initiatives are bolted-on as opposed to thinking about DX more strategically and looking for true transformation.<br /><br />Two major culprits behind these bolt-on &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; strategies are cost-saving measures and an analogue culture. Leadership in enterprises is well aware of the benefits of digital transformation but have often proceeded without consideration for culture and the drivers mentioned. This results in them consistently battling to keep up with the smaller companies who are taking their market share.<br /><br />Given the focus and investment in digital transformation across South African businesses, one can be optimistic that we&rsquo;re at least going in the right direction as a collective; we&rsquo;re tending towards a truly transformed industry. Our large companies are inherently slow to change due to the size, and that&rsquo;s before taking compliance into account.<br /><br />Still, we must persevere or inevitably fail. So, while bolting-on some digital services, processes or products could offer short-term relief, statistics show clearly that it will stunt future potential. Instead, take the hard road to create and install digital culture in the minds and hearts right across the business. Create a supportive environment where it becomes natural to think this way repeatedly and continuously.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Technology teams, departments and industry still hold a reputation for failed projects, where customers and product owners spend too much for too little, or where results pale in comparison to expectations held. We hear about these unmet expectations all the time, followed by budgets blown on project extensions and scope changes. We also hear about customers who &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know what they want&rdquo;, or who &ldquo;keep changing their minds&rdquo;. Sound familiar?\n  \n Many of these projects are unknowingly sabotaged before they start. This is because expectations are mismatched out the starting blocks, and there is little chance that the solution could ever go on to solve the meaningful problems faced in reality. This is a scary situation which traps all parties in projects which are destined to fail. It&rsquo;s worth spending the time upfront to clarify expectations and give your projects the best possible chance of success.\n  \n Here are four important concepts to help you avoid self-sabotage by communicating your requirements effectively:\n  \n 1. Describe the problem, not the solution\nYou know your business best. Instinctively, you would want to explain how you would solve the problems your business is experiencing. However, this often causes more harm than good. Describing your requirements as solutions will deprive you of the opportunity to explore multiple different solutions with your development team which might have stemmed from a clear problem-statement. We need to recognise that we&rsquo;re usually not all that great at explaining what we need but are probably quite good at explaining our problems.\n  \n Focus on the problem space instead. Spend the effort clearly describing the challenges which exist, and what success would look and feel like. Let the experts contribute to the problem-solving process &ndash; it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re there and it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re good at. When combining good requirements and good problem solving, you allow optimisation for time, scope and quality (and a great overall solution).\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 2. Try not to hide complexity\nWhen compiling requirements, it is important not to mix concepts or priorities in a way which will disorient your audience. Priority should flow from top to bottom, and requirements should be clustered around the problems they&rsquo;re linked to. What you may consider to be a very complex need may in fact be a simple feature. In contrast, one innocuous line in a requirements brief could ultimately account for a disproportionate amount of the work.\n  \n Hidden complexity leads to time bombs ticking away in your backlog. Requirements should be logically grouped, and clear enough for your audience to easily spot this hidden complexity so you can clarify it and defuse the bomb before getting started.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 3. Manage expectations\nExpectations must be shared and discussed early and often. Seasoned project managers and experienced software engineers know that expectation management is an important part of any successful software development project. There needs to be a communication culture to ensure that there are shared perspectives of the end result. The tree swing analogy depicts how different parties interpret and implement requirements during the development process. When there is a lack of shared understanding during these processes, stakeholders often genuinely think they are interpreting requirements correctly, but disaster ensues once results are visible and material.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 4. Prioritisation is key\nOnce there is a clear set of requirements, it is important to rank them. Requirements will vary wildly in complexity, time and cost, which makes a shared understanding of priority fundamental to success.\n  \n Prioritisation should weigh up what&rsquo;s important versus what&rsquo;s urgent, consider the right mix of functionality and differentiation, and take value versus effort into account. Techniques like the MoSCoW method can be used to build this prioritisation puzzle to create a solution that maximises time, cost, customer and business value, and operational objectives.\n  \n &bull; Must have: Non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory to complete the project\n&bull; Should have: Important features that aren't vital, but add significant value\n&bull; Could have: Nice-to-have features that would only have a small impact if left out\n&bull; Won't have: Features that aren't a priority for the current scope\n  \n This allows the development team to arrange the project into phases, plan for minimum viable product (MVP) releases when necessary and have the &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo; requirements in scope for future phases.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n \nRequirements are often the primary medium of communication throughout development. Communicating them effectively is clearly not a trivial exercise. Describing needs well means agreeing on expectations between parties from the very different perspectives held by technology, business, product and strategy. It also means that dissonance is managed and dispelled as early as possible in the process.\n  \n Stop sabotaging your projects. Detail your challenges more so than your preconceived solutions, try not to hide complexity, work to establish shared expectations, and be clear about what is important versus what is urgent. Set yourself up for success.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sizing up UX: Motivating for UX budget and scoping design time effectively&quot;}">Sizing up UX: Motivating for UX budget and scoping design time effectively</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sizing for user experience (UX) is a complex topic and poses challenges to business development and delivery management teams, as well as UX engineers (UXEs) themselves. We&rsquo;ll look at some of those challenges, as well as methods to overcome them and scope projects effectively.\n  \n Challenge 01: Organisational UX maturity\n  \n Many of the challenges UXEs face when sizing UX tasks relate directly back to the UX maturity of their organisations. UX maturity is how far along an organisation is in its adoption of UX as a fundamental part of the software delivery process. While good UX is crucial to the success of any digital product, in many organisations work still needs to be done to fully integrate UX into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).\n  \n  \n  \n If a company is in the early stages of UX adoption, simply motivating for UX research and design to be part of a project&rsquo;s scope is a challenge. To organisations with low UX maturity, UX may seem more academic than practical due to its research-intensive nature.\n  \n While the value of user research and user-centred design has proved itself over time among Fortune 500 companies, it's still seen as redundant by many stakeholders. These stakeholders often feel they know their users better than their users know themselves. This makes actually receiving any budget to consider UX more of a challenge than scoping accurately.\n  \n Challenge 02: Giving definite sizes to iterative processes\n  \n The second challenge is giving finite timelines to tasks that form part of iterative design processes. Iterative design uses cyclical processes of research, prototyping and testing to optimise and refine design over time. Based on insights gleaned from user testing results, the UXE will often change and adapt their prototypes to either validate or challenge their design decisions. A prototype might go through three or four iterations, or it may take months of rework, ideation and testing to truly answer a user&rsquo;s needs.\n  \n  \n  \n The solution: Prove the value of UX without going over budget\n  \n While challenges will always present themselves, the UXE needs to be strategic in their selection of research and design methods to optimise delivery and stay within budget. It&rsquo;s a tricky balance that requires negotiation, paired with advocacy and education around UX to convince resistant stakeholders.\n  \n The power of open dialogue\n It is essential to engage in candid discussions prior to the procurement phase and well before project kick-off. One way to do this is to include product owners and other decision-makers in design thinking workshops. These workshops, such as the now well-known Design Sprint, should be conducted prior to planning and budgeting. This is where design, business and technology representatives will work together to map out the business landscape and define mutual goals for the project, ensuring strategic alignment and understanding. If you don&rsquo;t engage with your stakeholders, crucial research or testing exercises will be excluded from the project due to a lack of understanding.\n  \n If successfully advocated for, the UXE can make use of a strategic arsenal of research and design methods to output effective software, and in turn, prove the value of UX. This exercise may need to happen several times before it is institutionalised, but once an organisation sees direct business value, it will become easier to negotiate scope on future projects.\n  \n You&rsquo;ve got the buy in, now it&rsquo;s time to size your UX tasks\n  \n Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;ve successfully advocated for UX, motivated for budget and developed a solid research strategy. It&rsquo;s now time to size the various UX tasks you feel you&rsquo;ll need to complete the project accurately. The importance of sticking to defined timelines is crucial to engender trust with your stakeholders. This is particularly true on fixed-price projects where there is little room for error and so you need to estimate with a high degree of confidence.\n  \n We can&rsquo;t account for the sizing of all UX tasks in a single article as that would require a book&rsquo;s worth of content, but we can look at some key tasks as examples. For the purposes of this article, we&rsquo;ll look at the sizing of qualitative and quantitative UX research.\n  \n Qualitative research scoping example: Contextual inquiries\n  \n We'll start with a well-established qualitative research method, the contextual inquiry. This is because it's a semi-structured interview method, making it difficult to estimate for. Contextual inquiries are intentionally less structured, as it allows users to go about their regular activities in their context of use. The UX researcher uses observation, as well as periodic and pointed questions to uncover key insights.\n  \n When sizing contextual inquiries or other forms of user research, there are two approaches you can use. The first is a dedicated time-box, in which you would conduct as many inquiries as you can within a given timeframe. The second is to decide on how many users you would like to observe and then pre-define how long you would need with each. Let's use the second example, as it is a bit more complex. We&rsquo;ll work with a single user, then scale it to form part of a full study.\n  \n The time you require to observe a user is dependent on the complexity of:\n  \n a. The system they use\nb. The tasks they need to complete\nc. The access to users themselves\n  \n Let's use a theoretical example of a task that takes a user 30 minutes to complete. We'll then need to double that time, to account for introducing yourself and the work you&rsquo;re intending to do, as well as getting consent to observe the user.\n  \n  \n  \n You now need to repeat this exercise with at least 5 participants to make your research effective.\n  \n  \n  \n With the added complexity of travel and setup, we can anticipate this task will take a full day.\n  \n  \n  \n Further to that is preparation time: Writing up consent forms, logistics and travel arrangements, as well as any background research that might be required. For this entire preparatory exercise, one might want to bank at least 2 days.\n  \n Following this is transcribing, collating and analysing the data, which may take as much time as the research itself.\n  \n  \n  \n We can now see that qualitative research has many dynamics that affect its timing. It&rsquo;s not much different from investigative journalism or in-store consumer research, so ensure you're accounting for all aspects of your research when scoping.\n  \n Quantitative research scoping: User surveys\n  \n Let&rsquo;s now look at a passive research method, the user survey. Surveys can take many forms and can use both qualitative and quantitative methods to gain results. The advantage of a survey is the same as its disadvantage, in that the researcher need not be present.\n  \n During the survey, the most time spent is on setup and analysing the findings afterwards, but the actual survey is relatively quick. If done through an online form, the survey can be conducted without the involvement of the UXE, meaning passive data collection.\n  \n  \n  \n The sizing of a survey is dependent on the number of questions needed to account for the relative complexity of a system or user. If a user or the system they use is particularly nuanced, one might need to develop a variety of questions over a few days. The following explores what goes into creating and sizing a survey:\n  \n 1. Defining the users you would need to survey to achieve your research aims\n  \n Meet with your product owner or an equivalent subject matter expert (SME) to determine who would be participating in the survey and what questions you will need answered. You will need to define the following:\n  \n a. Is there a single user group or many distinct groups requiring separate surveys?\nb. Run a research gap analysis: What don't you know about your users?\nc. What is the complexity of the system you are designing for?\n  \n The total time spent on your survey preparation can range from a single day to several days. Let&rsquo;s assume the user base is somewhat homogenous and the system is relatively simple. In this case, you will only need a day or two of preparation.\n  \n 2. Writing your survey and choosing the appropriate technology\n  \n You now have the necessary background information and stakeholder alignment on your research aims and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t need to spend more than a day writing your survey. Use online survey tools such as Google Forms, which offers data visualisation and CSV exports to assist in your analysis (it&rsquo;s also free).\n  \n 3. Determining how long should you run your survey\n  \n Once you&rsquo;ve sent an email of your survey out to your chosen participants, you&rsquo;ll need at least 10% of them to respond. If the survey is internal, you can aim for a 30 &ndash;40% response rate.\n  \n If you hit your response target, you can use the law of diminishing returns to decide whether to continue your survey or begin analysing your results. If sent using a well-marketed email, you&rsquo;ll generally have a large uptake in the beginning of your survey. After a few weeks, your respondents will plateau before they drop off entirely. You&rsquo;ll want to close your survey and begin analysing your results before the responses plateau.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n 4. Analysing your survey data\n  \n Once you&rsquo;ve gathered all your data, you&rsquo;ll need to spend a fair bit of time combing through results and trying to find patterns. The time spent will be dependent on how disparate or diverse your results are. If the survey answers are one-sided, then you won&rsquo;t have to spend much time on analysis. Let's extend our example of a relatively homogenous user base and assume the following:\n  \n a. We created a simple survey made up of 10 multiple-choice and yes/no questions\nb. We included 2 or 3 qualitative questions that will need to be read and interpreted\nc. We received 200 out of 2000 responses over a period of one week\nd. We found most answers have a distinct pattern with minor disparities\n  \n Based on the example above, we can assume our analysis and reporting won&rsquo;t take more than 2 days. The total active time spent on the survey would therefore be around 4 days, while the total time required would be approximately two weeks.\n  \n Estimating design time\n \nOnce research is complete, you will need to apply your findings. This means coming up with prototypes that truly represent and integrate your research. The scoping of prototyping is often defined by the research outcomes and is therefore a bit tricky on fixed-price projects. You often don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll be designing until you do the research.\n  \n If you&rsquo;re in a situation where you need to define the scope of design before having conducted research, you will need to analyse work you&rsquo;ve done on previous projects. For example, you may have designed a similar system in the past or you may have been a user of a system not much different from the one you&rsquo;re required to design. With this type of knowledge, you can begin to estimate the following:\n  \n a. The number of screens that would make up the user-flow\nb. The relative complexity of the system\nc. The features that the user would need to achieve their goals\n  \n Implementation and measuring success\n \nOnce your prototypes have been designed, tested and refined, it&rsquo;s time to hand over to the development team to implement the design vision. It&rsquo;s crucial you put measurements in place to track the success of your system, as this will be fundamental in negotiating scope on future projects. Success metrics will also assist in UX adoption more broadly at your organisation. We can therefore add a few more steps to our iterative design thinking model:\n  \n  \n  \n It&rsquo;s certainly a complex task going from advocacy for UX, to the negotiation of budgets and resources, and finally executing your design strategy. Keep the following in mind when unpacking this process:\n  \n  Align all stakeholders from the start, under a user-centred goal\n Estimate research and design time as accurately as possible\n Define measurements of success to prove value of over time\n   \n In the end it&rsquo;s all about advocating for the user\n  \n Sizing for UX and negotiating budgets all relates back to the UXE&rsquo;s central purpose of user advocacy. It&rsquo;s the UXE&rsquo;s job to give the user a voice and bring them into business and technology discussions when planning a delivery schedule. This means that the UXE needs to push back if there is a real chance of under-delivery, due to lack of user research and testing. If you fail to provide a good user experience, the cost saved on research methods will be outweighed by lack of user adoption and failed user experiences. As the saying goes, &lsquo;there is never enough time to do it right, but there is always enough time to do it over.&rsquo;&quot;}">

<div>Sizing for user experience (UX) is a complex topic and poses challenges to business development and delivery management teams, as well as UX engineers (UXEs) themselves. We&rsquo;ll look at some of those challenges, as well as methods to overcome them and scope projects effectively.<br /><br />Challenge 01: Organisational UX maturity<br /><br />Many of the challenges UXEs face when sizing UX tasks relate directly back to the UX maturity of their organisations. UX maturity is how far along an organisation is in its adoption of UX as a fundamental part of the software delivery process. While good UX is crucial to the success of any digital product, in many organisations work still needs to be done to fully integrate UX into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).<br /><br /><br /><br />If a company is in the early stages of UX adoption, simply motivating for UX research and design to be part of a project&rsquo;s scope is a challenge. To organisations with low UX maturity, UX may seem more academic than practical due to its research-intensive nature.<br /><br />While the value of user research and user-centred design has proved itself over time among Fortune 500 companies, it's still seen as redundant by many stakeholders. These stakeholders often feel they know their users better than their users know themselves. This makes actually receiving any budget to consider UX more of a challenge than scoping accurately.<br /><br />Challenge 02: Giving definite sizes to iterative processes<br /><br />The second challenge is giving finite timelines to tasks that form part of iterative design processes. Iterative design uses cyclical processes of research, prototyping and testing to optimise and refine design over time. Based on insights gleaned from user testing results, the UXE will often change and adapt their prototypes to either validate or challenge their design decisions. A prototype might go through three or four iterations, or it may take months of rework, ideation and testing to truly answer a user&rsquo;s needs.<br /><br /><br /><br />The solution: Prove the value of UX without going over budget<br /><br />While challenges will always present themselves, the UXE needs to be strategic in their selection of research and design methods to optimise delivery and stay within budget. It&rsquo;s a tricky balance that requires negotiation, paired with advocacy and education around UX to convince resistant stakeholders.<br /><br />The power of open dialogue<br />It is essential to engage in candid discussions prior to the procurement phase and well before project kick-off. One way to do this is to include product owners and other decision-makers in design thinking workshops. These workshops, such as the now well-known Design Sprint, should be conducted prior to planning and budgeting. This is where design, business and technology representatives will work together to map out the business landscape and define mutual goals for the project, ensuring strategic alignment and understanding. If you don&rsquo;t engage with your stakeholders, crucial research or testing exercises will be excluded from the project due to a lack of understanding.<br /><br />If successfully advocated for, the UXE can make use of a strategic arsenal of research and design methods to output effective software, and in turn, prove the value of UX. This exercise may need to happen several times before it is institutionalised, but once an organisation sees direct business value, it will become easier to negotiate scope on future projects.<br /><br />You&rsquo;ve got the buy in, now it&rsquo;s time to size your UX tasks<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;ve successfully advocated for UX, motivated for budget and developed a solid research strategy. It&rsquo;s now time to size the various UX tasks you feel you&rsquo;ll need to complete the project accurately. The importance of sticking to defined timelines is crucial to engender trust with your stakeholders. This is particularly true on fixed-price projects where there is little room for error and so you need to estimate with a high degree of confidence.<br /><br />We can&rsquo;t account for the sizing of all UX tasks in a single article as that would require a book&rsquo;s worth of content, but we can look at some key tasks as examples. For the purposes of this article, we&rsquo;ll look at the sizing of qualitative and quantitative UX research.<br /><br />Qualitative research scoping example: Contextual inquiries<br /><br />We'll start with a well-established qualitative research method, the contextual inquiry. This is because it's a semi-structured interview method, making it difficult to estimate for. Contextual inquiries are intentionally less structured, as it allows users to go about their regular activities in their context of use. The UX researcher uses observation, as well as periodic and pointed questions to uncover key insights.<br /><br />When sizing contextual inquiries or other forms of user research, there are two approaches you can use. The first is a dedicated time-box, in which you would conduct as many inquiries as you can within a given timeframe. The second is to decide on how many users you would like to observe and then pre-define how long you would need with each. Let's use the second example, as it is a bit more complex. We&rsquo;ll work with a single user, then scale it to form part of a full study.<br /><br />The time you require to observe a user is dependent on the complexity of:<br /><br />a. The system they use<br />b. The tasks they need to complete<br />c. The access to users themselves<br /><br />Let's use a theoretical example of a task that takes a user 30 minutes to complete. We'll then need to double that time, to account for introducing yourself and the work you&rsquo;re intending to do, as well as getting consent to observe the user.<br /><br /><br /><br />You now need to repeat this exercise with at least 5 participants to make your research effective.<br /><br /><br /><br />With the added complexity of travel and setup, we can anticipate this task will take a full day.<br /><br /><br /><br />Further to that is preparation time: Writing up consent forms, logistics and travel arrangements, as well as any background research that might be required. For this entire preparatory exercise, one might want to bank at least 2 days.<br /><br />Following this is transcribing, collating and analysing the data, which may take as much time as the research itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />We can now see that qualitative research has many dynamics that affect its timing. It&rsquo;s not much different from investigative journalism or in-store consumer research, so ensure you're accounting for all aspects of your research when scoping.<br /><br />Quantitative research scoping: User surveys<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s now look at a passive research method, the user survey. Surveys can take many forms and can use both qualitative and quantitative methods to gain results. The advantage of a survey is the same as its disadvantage, in that the researcher need not be present.<br /><br />During the survey, the most time spent is on setup and analysing the findings afterwards, but the actual survey is relatively quick. If done through an online form, the survey can be conducted without the involvement of the UXE, meaning passive data collection.<br /><br /><br /><br />The sizing of a survey is dependent on the number of questions needed to account for the relative complexity of a system or user. If a user or the system they use is particularly nuanced, one might need to develop a variety of questions over a few days. The following explores what goes into creating and sizing a survey:<br /><br />1. Defining the users you would need to survey to achieve your research aims<br /><br />Meet with your product owner or an equivalent subject matter expert (SME) to determine who would be participating in the survey and what questions you will need answered. You will need to define the following:<br /><br />a. Is there a single user group or many distinct groups requiring separate surveys?<br />b. Run a research gap analysis: What don't you know about your users?<br />c. What is the complexity of the system you are designing for?<br /><br />The total time spent on your survey preparation can range from a single day to several days. Let&rsquo;s assume the user base is somewhat homogenous and the system is relatively simple. In this case, you will only need a day or two of preparation.<br /><br />2. Writing your survey and choosing the appropriate technology<br /><br />You now have the necessary background information and stakeholder alignment on your research aims and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t need to spend more than a day writing your survey. Use online survey tools such as Google Forms, which offers data visualisation and CSV exports to assist in your analysis (it&rsquo;s also free).<br /><br />3. Determining how long should you run your survey<br /><br />Once you&rsquo;ve sent an email of your survey out to your chosen participants, you&rsquo;ll need at least 10% of them to respond. If the survey is internal, you can aim for a 30 &ndash;40% response rate.<br /><br />If you hit your response target, you can use the law of diminishing returns to decide whether to continue your survey or begin analysing your results. If sent using a well-marketed email, you&rsquo;ll generally have a large uptake in the beginning of your survey. After a few weeks, your respondents will plateau before they drop off entirely. You&rsquo;ll want to close your survey and begin analysing your results before the responses plateau.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4. Analysing your survey data<br /><br />Once you&rsquo;ve gathered all your data, you&rsquo;ll need to spend a fair bit of time combing through results and trying to find patterns. The time spent will be dependent on how disparate or diverse your results are. If the survey answers are one-sided, then you won&rsquo;t have to spend much time on analysis. Let's extend our example of a relatively homogenous user base and assume the following:<br /><br />a. We created a simple survey made up of 10 multiple-choice and yes/no questions<br />b. We included 2 or 3 qualitative questions that will need to be read and interpreted<br />c. We received 200 out of 2000 responses over a period of one week<br />d. We found most answers have a distinct pattern with minor disparities<br /><br />Based on the example above, we can assume our analysis and reporting won&rsquo;t take more than 2 days. The total active time spent on the survey would therefore be around 4 days, while the total time required would be approximately two weeks.<br /><br />Estimating design time<br /><br />Once research is complete, you will need to apply your findings.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The majority of modern technology teams following a Lean-Agile path are familiar with the &ldquo;deliver early and often&rdquo; approach. Even though continuous milestone delivery is a common focus, directing efforts to put something in the client&rsquo;s hands as early as possible to build trust, is not.\n Too often development teams get stuck in delivering to &ldquo;themselves&rdquo; and prioritising technology. This alienates the product owner, analysts, sponsor and any non-developers who really need to see progress and problems being solved in a way they can understand &ndash; especially in the beginning of the project. Odds are, the business spent months, if not years, trying to sell the project internally before being able to bring on a development team. When the project finally kicks off, it&rsquo;s only natural that the business feels some excitement and nervousness.\n What normally goes wrong\nDevelopment teams are technically-inclined, so they will naturally focus on the foundational technology in the beginning. This is important, but doesn&rsquo;t have intrinsic business value. The time spent on algorithms and the back-end is difficult to showcase to non-technical stakeholders, and will often be seen as invisible work.\n Business loses interest if there is too much focus on engineering preferences in early milestones. This will cause stakeholders to feel overwhelmed and isolated from the project. At the other end, if an effort is made to include the business at the start of the project and the focus is on business priorities, stakeholders&rsquo; sentiments will increase and trust will grow.

Even though continuous milestone delivery is a common focus, directing efforts to put something in the client&rsquo;s hands as early as possible to build trust, is not.<br />Too often development teams get stuck in delivering to &ldquo;themselves&rdquo; and prioritising technology. This alienates the product owner, analysts, sponsor and any non-developers who really need to see progress and problems being solved in a way they can understand &ndash; especially in the beginning of the project. Odds are, the business spent months, if not years, trying to sell the project internally before being able to bring on a development team. When the project finally kicks off, it&rsquo;s only natural that the business feels some excitement and nervousness.<br />What normally goes wrong<br />Development teams are technically-inclined, so they will naturally focus on the foundational technology in the beginning. This is important, but doesn&rsquo;t have intrinsic business value. The time spent on algorithms and the back-end is difficult to showcase to non-technical stakeholders, and will often be seen as invisible work.<br />Business loses interest if there is too much focus on engineering preferences in early milestones. This will cause stakeholders to feel overwhelmed and isolated from the project. At the other end, if an effort is made to include the business at the start of the project and the focus is on business priorities, stakeholders&rsquo; sentiments will increase and trust will grow.

Before an experiment, you were likely asked to come up with an assumption that could be tested &ndash; a scientific hypothesis. The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome &ndash; and is usually shrouded in uncertainty.\n If we see building technology solutions as experiments to learn what customers want and what is good for a business, we can similarly treat any of these programmes as a series of experiments. A sequence of hypotheses, working towards a sequence of goals. The hypothesis is the building block in the scientific method, and should be in agile development too.\n In modern agile-inspired approaches, teams need to deliver newer, better, and more robust features to customers in increasingly shorter timeframes. The work being carried out is usually determined by a product owner and often assumed as &ldquo;proven&rdquo; before testing it with real users. These features frequently accumulate into mammoth applications where the full breadth of functionality is not utilised, or the application is not user friendly &ndash; or more severely &ndash; the solution doesn&rsquo;t truly solve problems for customers.\n\n\n\n\n To facilitate learning what actually solves problems, hypotheses should be considered and documented for every feature being built to create clarity in purpose. Engineering teams should experiment early and often, receive feedback from customers, and make data-driven decisions based on the findings from every experiment.\n Establish hypotheses that can teach you things\nClear and predetermined requirements are only valuable when several possible solutions have already been tested and validated. However, when you are exploring an initiative with a high-level of uncertainty (which most digital projects are), using atomic hypotheses to guide what features development teams build will ultimately result in building the right thing as you continually adapt away from failed experiments and towards the successful ones.\n To form a useful hypothesis, focus on pieces of functionality from a user&rsquo;s perspective. How will they interact with the solution, and what fundamental problem is it solving for the user? Ensure that these pieces of the solution are small enough to develop within a sprint, and be tested with real-world users directly after that sprint. This will allow you to focus on what works, and parking or discarding the rest. Keep in mind that the larger the feature, the more effort and cost is involved in maintaining, testing, and working around the feature.\n Use technology to validate (or invalidate) your hypothesis\nOnce you have an agreed-upon hypothesis in place, you&rsquo;ll need to iteratively prove or disprove it throughout the development phases using the tools at your disposal. These validations can be as simple as workshops or focus groups, or may take a little more user research against prototypes to find a conclusive result. In some instances, it&rsquo;s worth building a proof of concept to pilot in the market (or pilot as a feature within a larger system).\n An effective step towards validation is having smaller, cross-functional teams that are able to complete the full cycle themselves, internally. Any requirement to &lsquo;hand off&rsquo; work into other teams for research and feedback will put the brakes on the experiment as context is lost and priorities aren&rsquo;t shared. Cross-functional teams include engineers, designers, and analysts &ndash; a multi-skilled team allows searching for, manifesting and learning viable ideas quickly.\n Adapt your solution via a series of experiments\nLet&rsquo;s consider an example where a business&rsquo; sign-up rate for their eCommerce platform is surprisingly low given the large volume of visitors they receive. To understand the product take-up problem given that marketing seems to be working, they&rsquo;d need to lay down several hypotheses which can be tested.\n1.  Hypothesis 1: Users are getting fatigued by sign-up form capture taking too long and losing interest. Experiment: Cut sign-up requirements to the bare minimum needed to transact, and allowing users to finish their profile at a later stage.\n2.  Hypothesis 2: The product is too expensive, so although there is huge interest in it, a low percentage of consumers are willing to spend the money. Experiment: Offer a slightly cheaper version of the product, with several cut-back features, and measure take-up.\n3. Hypothesis 3: There is a lack of trust in the product, and visitors are unwilling to sign up (or provide personal details) until they have experienced it. Experiment: Dramatically lower the barrier to entry by allowing guest-transacting and only requiring users to register once they&rsquo;ve completely taken up the product.\n With these experiments in play (albeit pilot versions, with potentially a small customer base) the business can go revisit each hypothesis to establish whether any or all of them were true or false, and then further invest in the solutions which have proven demonstrably more effective at driving product uptake. This process can repeat as the product evolves.\n Testing atomic ideas quickly is advantageous in finding better solutions for businesses , and should be utilised as often as possible. This approach works well with agile-based development due to the short release cycles and ability to adapt quickly.\n In hypothesis-driven development, every major feature is an experiment, and every experiment must start with an educated guess. Your goal should be to establish a clear hypothesis for each initiative, and then focus engineering efforts to prove or disprove it. This way, you&rsquo;ll build products that ultimately succeed in delivering against a clear and measurable user or business goal.&quot;}">

In communications, this means they are able to listen attentively, be assertive and concise. Great engineers also able to present themselves without aggression.\n  \n Awareness and analytical nature: Some engineers struggle with &lsquo;tunnel vision&rsquo; into the solution space, where they focus too much on the solution without properly evaluating the problem. Great software engineers are astute, able to place requirements in context and maintain awareness of the problem-space while working through the solution.\n  \n This awareness should pervade all aspects of their work, especially the ability to be aware of what already exists in a given solution, and how it can be reused to solve requirements more efficiently or in ways that weren&rsquo;t directly suggested. One of the hallmarks of great software engineers is a shrewd talent for solving problems on their feet in meetings, workshops and pair-programming scenarios.\n  \n Maturity in approach: Great software engineers apply their mind to all aspects of the engineering process in a considered and non-selfish way. Here are a few examples of what this means in practice:\n  \n  Seeking constructive criticism &ndash; great engineers ask what they could be missing in a design, how would it not work and whether it is understandable to the users and the rest of the team\n Asking for the background of a requirement to see how it fits into things and seeing the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; &ndash; great engineers look to stabilise requirements before rushing ahead with development.

Being senior is less about how many years you have worked and more about your maturity, competence and value you can provide to a team. The best software engineers see this for what it is &ndash; an opportunity. Furthering a career in the field is about understanding the context and demonstrating an insight into what makes a software engineer a &lsquo;senior&rsquo; or a &lsquo;lead&rsquo; within that organisation. Armed with that knowledge, great software engineers can tailor their skills and initiative to push themselves further.\n  \n Ultimately, what separates great engineers from good engineers is a natural maturity in approach, personality and attitude that goes beyond the expected competence in the technical aspects of the software craft. This might seem counterintuitive given the implied technical depth in the job and to be fair, in many positions, an expert level technical competency is an absolute minimum.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;South African companies are not only competing within a national context for top-tier software talent but they are also up against international organisations on their own soil. These organisations have cut their teeth in far more competitive markets and have decades of experience in managing software environments on the South African companies. It is not breaking news either that there is a very limited pool of skills to draw on, and to top it off, in South Africa, there is a through-the-roof demand on enterprise developers in all sectors. This dangerous combination and a heavily imbalanced supply-and-demand picture has forced software-service companies and corporates to take a closer look at their retention rates and invest in programmes designed to improve these figures, or suffer churn as the talent is pulled towards the highest bidder.\n The problem with this approach is that companies are designing loyalty programmes to mitigate that fact and as a result, they avoid the tough questions that examine the organisational causes of staff churn. When used in this way, loyalty programmes are the equivalent of sweeping the problem under the carpet. They cannot solve fundamental, underlying issues that require investment and political will to transform, much in the same way that a Band-Aid cannot stop arterial bleeding. Giving employees a free smoothie is not going to keep them working for you, let alone engaged with their work if they have a poor relationship with their team, have very little input, control or ownership of their work, or work in the basement of a dilapidated building with poor ventilation.\n The power of a loyalty programme lies in its ability to enhance what is already a working organisational culture, and to incentivise positive behaviour.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;This time of year is critical for recruitment. Many companies are actively searching universities all over the country to secure the best candidates to join their graduate programmes. Similarly, many graduates are entering the job market for the first time and are navigating their way around the recruitment space, looking for the right recruitment agent to help them identify the best career opportunity.\n  \n However, in recent years there has been an increasing trend by recruiters to ask candidates to sign what has been called a Candidate Liability Clause. Given that a large number of graduate candidates are new to the recruitment industry, many assume that all components of these agreements are standard practice.\n  \n The most contentious component of these agreements is that if a candidate reneges on an offer after written acceptance, the recruitment agency claims damages against the candidate. Usually, the agency demands from the candidate an amount equal to the commission or fee they would have earned upon successful placement.\n  \n While this practice is not common, it has been in existence for some years. In 2012, the Federation of African Professional Staffing Organisations (APSO) amended its Code of Ethical and Professional Practice, banning the use of the Candidate Liability Clause. As such, it required all members of APSO to adhere to this ban and provided a candidate notification that informed candidates that an agency&rsquo;s only right would be to seek damages in line with their legal rights.\n  \n However, the frequency of this Candidate Liability Clause practice suggests that there is still a lack of clarity around this issue and what is permitted.\n  \n Carmen Williams, General Manager: Talent Acquisition at Entelect, says, &ldquo;At this time of year, graduates are planning for their first job. Many of them will be stepping into the recruitment space for the first time.&rdquo;\n  \n She believes it is critical that candidates understand how the recruitment industry works so that they are not misled by unethical practices.\n  \n &ldquo;Successful placements can only exist when a candidate wants to join a company, not because the candidate feels intimidated into joining by the prospect of incurring damages fees if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;\n  \n APSO has also joined the discussion in an attempt to provide clarity on the issue. While APSO recognises that some members may wish to seek damages in certain instances, it expressly prohibits recruitment agencies using a Candidate Liability Clause as a means of recovering these damages. Part of the problem, explains Roly Boardman, chairman of the APSO Ethics Committee, is that there is currently no requirement for recruitment agencies to be members of an industry body such as APSO.\n  \n &ldquo;Membership of APSO would serve to monitor unethical practices and give candidates recourse when a dispute occurs,&rdquo; he says.\n  \n So, why is this practice bad for business?\n  \n Firstly, contracting a candidate to cover damages should they decide to change their mind on an offer is not conducive to a successful placement. A candidate who feels bound to a job offer through fear of incurring damages fees is likely to enter that position in a negative state of mind and feel cheated out of their preferred choice. Jobs that start like this do not last and replacing these employees incurs more expense in the longer term.\n  \n Secondly, a large number of companies are not aware that potential candidates are asked to sign this document. Consequently, it can be a poor reflection on the companies these agencies represent, not to mention that this practice may be in stark contrast with the values of the organisations they serve.\n  \n Thirdly, this practice can result in a poorly matched placement. On the one hand, a company may lose out on an excellent candidate because he or she is unable to change their mind. On the other, a company may take on an employee who would have preferred to join another company.\n  \n Williams has a good view of both sides of the industry and believes that this issue points to the role of the recruiter.\n  \n &ldquo;The role of the recruitment agent is to help both the candidate and the company make the best decision,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;If the recruiter is prepared to nurture this part of the process, damages fees should not be an issue.&rdquo;\n  \n  \n What should company&rsquo;s and candidates look for?\n  \n 1. When it comes to identifying the right candidate for the right role, the onus is on the recruiter to perform greater due diligence throughout the recruitment process. Boardman supports this view by asking the question, &ldquo;Surely we cannot employ people without personal interaction?&rdquo; He firmly believes that we need to bring personality back into the recruitment process, saying, &ldquo;We simply cannot afford to miss out on good candidates because the right information was not discovered.&rdquo;\n  \n 2. Part of a recruiter&rsquo;s process is to counsel candidates on what to do in case of a counter offer, helping them understand the pros and cons of accepting a counter offer. It is in the interest of all parties involved that the candidate takes the best career opportunity available to realise a successful recruitment process.\n  \n 3. Candidates and companies should ask a potential recruitment agent whether they are a member of APSO. This way they know a code of ethics is being followed, and should there be any cause for recourse or dispute, all parties involved have the support of an independent party.\n  \n  \n When engaging a recruitment agency&rsquo;s service, companies and candidates should find out what the terms of engagement are. If an agency does indeed apply a damages fee, then companies need to consider how this may affect them.\n  \n &ldquo;A candidate must be free of coercion of any sort to make the right decision for them,&rdquo; concludes Williams. &ldquo;It is important that companies start to determine the kind of practices they want from the recruitment industry, and start demanding it, or only work with those recruiters who share your organisation's values.\&quot;&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;As software engineers, we need to stay on top of a continuously evolving industry - the stronger and more diverse our community network of engineers and developers, the greater chance we have to remain relevant.\n  \n Communities are popping up in all areas of our lives because people no longer just do one job or hobby, they have a number of passion projects and interests. Increased connectivity and social media have enabled this. Finding a good community is like finding your perfect match; when it's good, the most amazing innovations can emerge from your collaborations with like-minded people.\n  \n We often think of communities as formally established groups but communities can also be much smaller groups of people that share similar ideologies. Often these people choose to define their connection in a way that reflects their social identity and practice. The most rewarding thing about communities can be the knowledge sharing and the personal networks that develop from them.\n  \n At first, it may seem obvious as to why it can be valuable to interact with the larger development community; to share knowledge. But, there are other advantages that are not always obvious until you are part of a development community.\n  \n 1. Sharing passions, ideas, and goals, can accelerate your personal growth exponentially. But the first, most important, trick to getting the most out of a community is not to look at it for what you can get out of it, but rather look at what you can offer.

For instance, have you considered ember.js as a tool when you hit the limits of your current Single Page Application framework and do you know what pitfalls to look out for? Or, do you know what options exist for bringing your next application into the augmented reality or virtual reality world of the future?\n  \n 3. In the same vein, because of the continuous evolution of the industry, troubleshooting is as much a learning curve as learning new languages and technologies. Communities provide software engineers with an experimental space to learn and also troubleshoot with like-minded people. The advantages of having a space to troubleshoot don't just apply to work in community forums, but also problems you may come up against in your day-to-day working environments. You&rsquo;ll find you are able to work through problems more quickly, which will ultimately add value to both your career and the projects that your employer is undertaking. Not to mention the insights you will bring to your community will increase exponentially.\n  \n 4. One of the less obvious but most compelling advantages of being part of a community is that it can give guidance to your career. Being in touch with the latest changes in the industry will help you to make strategic decisions about your future career; where you want to be three years from now, what skills you need to get there, and most importantly, how to stay relevant. Fostering relationships in a community will have a positive effect on your career; who knows who you may meet?\n  \n  \n We&rsquo;re lucky in South Africa; we have access to a number of international communities such as GitHub and stackoverflow, but also some locally emerging communities such as source.technology.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The company breakaway is often dismissed as a day or two out of the office for a bit of fun and a few hours of discussion about the business. More often than not, the phenomenal ideas that seemed so innovative around the table never materialise. Lessons learnt are quickly forgotten and the passionate commitment to &ldquo;doing things differently&rdquo; and &ldquo;going the extra mile&rdquo; soon gets swallowed up in the daily grind.\n  \n But according to Doug Crawford, manager: service delivery at Entelect, the breakaway is still highly relevant in today&rsquo;s business environment. In fact, he believes it&rsquo;s more relevant than ever.\n  \n Entelect is a software development company that runs teams of on-site developers across a range of clients and projects throughout South Africa. Each project is operationally independent, which means there&rsquo;s no need for the project teams to interact or engage with each other. However, from a strategic and developmental perspective, there is a lot they can learn from each other.\n  \n &ldquo;Each year we take a day out of the office to bring together our project team leaders from across the country &ndash; we call them &lsquo;team leads&rsquo; &ndash; to share experiences and discuss creative and innovative ways to address common challenges in the business,&rdquo; says Crawford. &ldquo;More importantly, the sessions give team leads and management the opportunity to interact in a dedicated and focused setting that allows for a healthy two-way communication that isn&rsquo;t easily achieved by other means.&rdquo;\n  \n Sounds like any other breakaway, right? But Crawford says these interventions have yielded several success stories over the years.\n  \n &ldquo;The breakaways are heavily solutions-focused,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Before the event we circulate a list of topics or tasks that will be unpacked during the course of the day. Team leads are required to make notes for discussion on each of the scenarios. On the day itself we divide the group into teams. Each team is allocated one of the topics to unpack and debate in the morning session. Teams then present their solutions to the group in the afternoon.&rdquo;\n  \n Some of the challenges from the last Entelect breakaway were:\n  \n &bull; Create a toolbox to help our new or young team leads run effective career, growth and performance discussions with their team members.\n &bull; Create an on-boarding pack that can be used by team leads and other team members to ensure new members joining a team have the best possible experience and are able to deliver value to the client and team at the earliest opportunity.\n &bull; How do we maximise visibility across the company of the technical achievements and innovations being delivered by our teams?\n &bull; How can I inspire a sense of purpose in my team that creates a common-ground for our client, staff and company interests?\n &bull; How do we ensure teams and clients are aware of and making use of Entelect&rsquo;s value-adding services?\n  \n &ldquo;The depth of discussion was impressive,&rdquo; says Crawford. &ldquo;As a management team we are already working on operationalising a number of the ideas that came out of the most recent session.&rdquo;\n Some of these are:\n An on-boarding toolbox to ensure a comprehensive and consistent on-boarding experience for new team members\n A discretionary &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; budget for each team to spend on anything that will make them happy\n Team CVs that list capabilities and achievements at team level leading to awareness and boosting profile within the company\n Generating thinking around value-add activities, e.g. knowledge sharing, training, events and workshops\n  \n The sessions also play a very important role when it comes to internal mentorship.\n  \n &ldquo;We currently have 44 team leads in the business,&rdquo; explains Crawford. &ldquo;Breakaways provide the ideal forum for the whole team to network and form relationships. Some people in the team are very experienced, while others are new to the role or to the business. During the breakaways we actively encourage connections between newer and more experienced team members, which serve as informal mentorship-type relationships.&rdquo;\n  \n It&rsquo;s not only management that sees value in these sessions. Team leads themselves gave some really positive feedback after the most recent breakaway.\n  \n &ldquo;I really enjoyed the day as a whole,&rdquo; says Jonathan Counihan, who works on one of Entelect&rsquo;s teams based at Sage. &ldquo;I like the fact that our input is valued and some actionable items come out of it. I think the networking aspect is also very good, as it gives the leads a chance to touch base and build support structures.\n  \n &ldquo;I really feel part of the team the way the Entelect management keeps us in the loop about the company strategy and vision.&rdquo;\n  \n Schalk Wolhuter, who leads the Entelect team at Discovery Vitality RSA, says, &ldquo;Put a group of highly motivated and bright individuals in a room, shake them a bit and out comes ideas and solutions.

LinkedIn estimates that 66% of its 350 million users are actively or passively seeking a job.\n So why is it that so many people are unhappy in their jobs? For me the answer is simple- people make career decisions based on the wrong reasons.\n During my past 8 years in recruitment I have interviewed hundreds of people, most of which couldn&rsquo;t tell me why they were really looking for a new job, what they were looking for in their next job or, what type of culture or environment would best suit them.\n People should be asking why do they want to leave. In data analytics a &lsquo;why&rsquo; analysis goes a long way. The process is to keep asking &lsquo;why&rsquo; until you get to the very core of why you want to leave so that you can understand what will make you feel fulfilled.\n Often we take the first offer, or move just for more money. In fact money is far too often associated with success &ndash; we think if we&rsquo;re earning more money then it&rsquo;s a measure of how successful we are. But a salary is not going to determine how much you will be challenged in your job or whether you will feel fulfilled by the day-to-day work.\n In the book &ldquo;In Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,&rdquo; Daniel Pink, says that knowledge workers are motivated by three things: autonomy, mastery and purpose.\n  \n Autonomy: when we are in control of what we do, how we do it, and when we do it. That should always be the case in a true Agile working environment.\n Mastery: when we are constantly learning and evolving, becoming better professionals and better human beings.\n Purpose: when we feel that our job is important and we are contributing to make things better, instead of just doing what we are told without understanding why.\n  \n Therefore, we see that people work for recognition, not money. Understandably, money does feature in the decision making process. However, we need to be more strategic about our choice and view money as one element rather than the most important element.\n  \n In my experience, people never leave a job because they dislike their salary, they become unhappy because they are not feeling fulfilled in other areas of their role and then the salary compounds the issue. Growth (mastery), a sense of independence (autonomy) and fulfilment that your job makes a significant impact on the lives of others somehow (purpose) are the defining factors.\n In the technology industry, these issues are compounded by the fact that the industry is fast-paced and growing exponentially. There are many new jobs emerging all the time, so this can make it harder to make your decision.\n So next time you go for an interview, why not change the questions you prepare for the interviewer to be focused on autonomy, mastery and purpose and appreciate the interesting conversation that unfolds.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Demand for software engineering skills continues to rise. According to a report issued by The Joburg Centre for Software Engineering (JCSE Skills Survey), a University of Witwatersrand partnership with government and industry, there is &lsquo;an immediate unsatisfied need for skills in the ICT sector&hellip;&rsquo;\n  \n At the end of 2015, a paper from Empirica (empirica) indicated that, &lsquo;the European market could absorb 756 000 ICT practitioners by 2020 if sufficient supply was available&rsquo;. And in June 2016, Cisco announced that it will invest $10 million over two years in a scholarship programme to increase the pool of talent (investor.cisco). Locally, the May 2016 edition of the Career Junction Index showed that Software Development remained the most sought-after skillset on the Career Junction website and just 25% of those jobs available in December 2016 were filled (CJI Executive Summary).\n  \n The reality is that, large software engineering companies are competing for skills and resources to deliver against the business opportunities, which are being driven by traditional industries such as financial services, insurance and healthcare sectors. But the competition is tough.\n  \n Companies competing in the IT space are continuously looking for ways to set themselves apart from their competitors, which is resulting in increased demand for high-quality software engineering candidates.\n  \n This year, Entelect took on 40 of the top Computer Science and Engineering candidates in the country, up from 30 in 2016. On an average month, Entelect employ anywhere between 5-10 full-time employees, which is testament to the number of opportunities out there at the moment.\n  \n But unlike many other industries, the South African Software industry should be considered as having a supply issue, rather than a demand issue. That means the industry simply cannot fill the jobs available with the necessary skills. Computer Science and Engineering is still listed by the Department of Higher Education and training as a scarce skill (DHET scarce skills) and although graduates are increasing, it is not at the pace the industry needs.\n  \n In our view, the most sought-after skills in the industry at the moment include Java, C# and Angular, and typically, candidates with these skills are in high-demand. However, it would be wrong to assume that because there is a supply challenge, this means it is easy to get a job in software engineering. The reality is that continuous increases in security, big data and consumer lifestyles makes this industry the backbone of many other, more established industries.\n  \n Hence, this supply issue places a challenge on the companies because service standards must remain high.\n  \n Software engineers need to demonstrate technical accuracy and extremely high levels of craftsmanship in every aspect of their job. The industry moves too quickly to absorb mistakes and technical errors so candidates must demonstrate exceptional skills.\n  \n However, technical accuracy alone is not enough. Candidates are also required to demonstrate other, softer skills, which will positively impact their ability to deliver effective solutions in teams, but these are often overlooked by candidates when selling themselves in an interview.\n  \n Craftsmanship: The drive to transform what is currently a skill into an art of exceptional ability.\n  \n EQ: Self-awareness and having a deep understanding of oneself is an important skill when managing teams and clients effectively.\n  \n Articulate: The ability to express ideas clearly and with a high-energy drive efficiencies and productivity in the workplace, especially when working on tough projects with tight deadlines.\n  \n Team spirit: People who have a strong team spirit tend to be collaborative, which is critical for identifying the best solution for the project or problem.\n  \n Confidence and passion: These traits drive behaviours such as the desire to learn new skills, techniques or technologies quickly, to go above and beyond your daily tasks and to bring creative flair to their role.\n  \n Once a candidate can demonstrate that they have the exceptional skills to create an impact, the opportunities available as an employee in this industry are extensive. Apart from exposure to cutting-edge innovation, there are many other less obvious benefits that candidates will be exposed to which are, arguably, unique to this industry.\n  \n Firstly, in a new industry there are many opportunities to create new solutions and address new problems. This means that the occasion to practice autonomy is far greater than in well-established industries where there are pre-defined best practices and rules of engagement. Autonomy is a significant growth accelerator.\n  \n Secondly, there is the opportunity to become a master in your field. The competitive nature of the software industry means that companies are looking for true crafts men and women. Being exceptional is the flavour of the day.\n  \n Thirdly, purpose. Employees today are looking for purpose in their jobs. Software engineering is often considered the backbone of many industries and as such, every problem software engineering solves will ultimately better or improve the lives of others somehow.\n  \n  \n Given this, when recruiters talk about &lsquo;opportunities&rsquo; in software engineering, they are not just talking about the number of jobs available in the market, although this is very true. They are talking about the opportunities for growth, personal development and purpose which are presented by a relatively new industry that is at the forefront of innovation.\n  \n Undoubtedly, the future of the software industry is on an exciting trajectory. The pace of innovation means that competition will remain extremely high. Candidates that can reap the rewards of this industry are those who can offer exceptional craftsmanship and understand the value of the softer skills in the delivery of the most agile and effective services and solutions a client can employ.\n  \n It is important to consider what additional skills you can offer a software company that will help set them apart from their competitors. Understand the marketplace, and your position in it. There are many good software developers, but exceptional ones are far fewer between.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:134,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://www.wits.ac.za/media/wits-university/news-and-events/images/documents/JCSE%20Skills%20Survey.pdf&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:152}{&quot;1&quot;:345,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.empirica.com/home.html&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:353}{&quot;1&quot;:616,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://investor.cisco.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/news/news-details/2016/Cisco-Launches-10-Million-Global-Cybersecurity-Scholarship-to-Increase-Talent-Pool-Introduces-New-and-Updated-Certifications/default.aspx&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:630}{&quot;1&quot;:863,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://investor.cisco.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/news/news-details/2016/Cisco-Launches-10-Million-Global-Cybersecurity-Scholarship-to-Increase-Talent-Pool-Introduces-New-and-Updated-Certifications/default.aspx&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:884}{&quot;1&quot;:2025,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;http://www.dhet.gov.za/Gazette/Government%20Gazette%20No%2039604,%2019%20January%202016.%20List%20of%20Occupations%20in%20High%20Demand%202015.pdf&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:2043}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The role of the data scientist is one of the broadest roles in the software engineering field at the moment with the expectations on these individuals being extremely high. However, there is growing controversy around the roles and responsibilities of a Data Scientist and at what point can you fairly call yourself a Data Scientist.\n  \n To begin, we need to be cognisant that the industry itself, especially in South Africa, is in its infancy. So industry standards which outline the breadth of knowledge required on Big Data and Analytics technologies have yet to be defined. Although, fundamentally, the role of the Data Scientist is closely linked to being Big Data developers and implementers of solutions that encompass large amounts of structured and unstructured data.\n  \n However, when hiring Data Scientists, we need to understand that there are only a handful of people with experience across the board. Organisations are mostly hiring people with pockets of knowledge or, graduates or juniors with the right passion. In reality, Data Scientists have many years of experience and a breadth and depth of knowledge that is relatively unique.\n  \n At Entelect, we believe the journey to Data Scientist begins as either a Big Data Engineer or a Big Data Analyst, and there is an important distinction between the two roles.\n  \n The Engineers are traditionally from a Software Engineering background. They have spent some time in the trenches learning Linux, networking and the Hadoop ecosystem. I&rsquo;m not limiting the Engineer role to the Apache technologies, most vendors are releasing amazing solutions that would classify them into the Big Data field; however, they are leveraging the initial architecture and concepts of Hadoop.\n  \n The Analysts typically come from a Maths and Statistics background. They have been tinkering with databases, ETL&rsquo;s and ELT&rsquo;s as well as basic data mining models. These guys understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, what a random forest is, and a vast array of other analytics techniques.\n  \n Both these roles set extremely strong foundations on the path to becoming a Data Scientist thanks to their problem-solving skills, both technical and logical. At this point, these individuals are now set to start moving up the ranks in terms of Data Science. However, there are still a number of learning imperatives required before becoming a Data Scientist.\n  \n At Entelect, we have established a training path to take these individuals towards the end goal of being a Data Scientist.\n  \n Moving to junior or intermediate level\n There are several decisions the engineers and analysts need to make. Initially, a lot of them are related to breadth versus depth of knowledge. I have always believed you should develop a vast breadth of knowledge across all relevant technology stacks and then focus on achieving depth of knowledge in relevant areas over time. If you are really committed, this means you end up with both breadth and depth of knowledge.\n  \n To tackle this, the data solutions side of Entelect created a roadmap designed to take a Big Data Engineer or Analyst through a structured programme to provide the breadth across the engineer and analyst role.\n This is similar to the Entelect Graduate Bootcamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFNj6fzOIAc), where graduates or juniors are provided with an overview of the main stream technologies, which helps them develop a breadth of skill and from there, the Graduates can move into specific areas of software.\n  \n For the data solutions training programme, we leverage a few of the MOOC&rsquo;s, a host of our internal training material but most importantly we use something known as a Structured Incubators approach.\n  \n The Structured Incubators provide real-world scenarios filled with mini challenges designed to expose everyone to all aspects of the Big Data environment. It covers everything from installing and configuring Linux clusters, all the way through to running their first data mining model. Several technologies are used, however the concepts learnt during these incubators are the key to success.\n  \n The most important key to a successful incubator is constant mentoring. At Entelect we have attracted several Big Data Engineers and Analysts and provide constant support to aspiring Data Scientists. Constant feedback loops are given to the participants though various mediums, frequent show and tell sessions are conducted, and several ad hoc challenges are given to the participants, ranging from taking 2 days out to enter a Kaggle competition all the way through to producing some real-world analytics on relevant subjects (http://source.technology/political-party-analysis).\n  \n Regardless of experience in the field, the initial training programme must be followed by all our engineers. If a person has experience in setting up clusters they are still required to complete the entire incubation period to ensure that everyone is on the same minimum level.\n  \n We have seen great success with this, constantly pushing the guys out of their comfort zone, throwing them in the deep end and making sure we provide the support for them to float.\n  \n This initial period takes roughly 10 weeks to achieve a broad overview. At this stage the individual is still operating at a Big Data engineer or analyst level.\n  \n Moving to intermediate level\n This field changes far too quickly for anyone to stand still and rest on their laurels for 6 months so growth isn&rsquo;t optional. We strive to help our engineers and analysts experience a variety of industry verticals and technologies to support their growth.\n  \n At this point, data engineers and analysts start finding their passion and gaining a depth of knowledge in a certain area. This is not a career direction, but more a career enhancement. The learning paths change slightly and more focus is given to the relevant area of interest. However, growth in the other areas never stop. If someone enjoy doing the data analysis we would focus the training roadmap more on R/Machine Learning/Python aspects. However, there will still be investment in furthering the knowledge on the engineering side and vice versa.\n  \n The roadmap for career growth is a long one. We estimate roughly two years of part-time focus to achieve solid, well-rounded knowledge to become a Junior Data Scientist. This would encompass understanding SQL, NoSQL HQL, Linux, Windows, Spark and another 90 technologies relevant to data science. All of this needs to be coupled with real world experience across various industry domains to develop the entire picture of implementations, use cases and critical success factors of big data projects.\n  \n  \n  \n So now you are a junior data scientist, what&rsquo;s next?\n At this point you should be able to take a blank slate, setup a big data environment, ingest data, execute useful analytics and provide a presentation layer to any organisation you are at.\n The next step is to continue deepening your knowledge, the focus is then put on advanced statistics, graph theory, advanced data structures, streaming analytics and finally we move into the Probabilistic Modelling and Deep Learning.\n  \n Once you have proven competency, a solid track record and a vast breadth and depth of knowledge, at this point you are considered a Data Scientist.\n  \n  \n As the industry becomes more established, we expect to see this path to Data Scientist becoming more commonplace. At Entelect, we use the roadmap to ensure our Data Scientists are true craftsmen in their field and can consistently provide the highest quality service and solutions to their clients at all times.&quot;}">

Constant feedback loops are given to the participants though various mediums, frequent show and tell sessions are conducted, and several ad hoc challenges are given to the participants, ranging from taking 2 days out to enter a Kaggle competition all the way through to producing some real-world analytics on relevant subjects (http://source.technology/political-party-analysis).<br /><br />Regardless of experience in the field, the initial training programme must be followed by all our engineers. If a person has experience in setting up clusters they are still required to complete the entire incubation period to ensure that everyone is on the same minimum level.<br /><br />We have seen great success with this, constantly pushing the guys out of their comfort zone, throwing them in the deep end and making sure we provide the support for them to float.<br /><br />This initial period takes roughly 10 weeks to achieve a broad overview. At this stage the individual is still operating at a Big Data engineer or analyst level.<br /><br />Moving to intermediate level<br />This field changes far too quickly for anyone to stand still and rest on their laurels for 6 months so growth isn&rsquo;t optional. We strive to help our engineers and analysts experience a variety of industry verticals and technologies to support their growth.<br /><br />At this point, data engineers and analysts start finding their passion and gaining a depth of knowledge in a certain area. This is not a career direction, but more a career enhancement. The learning paths change slightly and more focus is given to the relevant area of interest. However, growth in the other areas never stop. If someone enjoy doing the data analysis we would focus the training roadmap more on R/Machine Learning/Python aspects. However, there will still be investment in furthering the knowledge on the engineering side and vice versa.<br /><br />The roadmap for career growth is a long one. We estimate roughly two years of part-time focus to achieve solid, well-rounded knowledge to become a Junior Data Scientist. This would encompass understanding SQL, NoSQL HQL, Linux, Windows, Spark and another 90 technologies relevant to data science. All of this needs to be coupled with real world experience across various industry domains to develop the entire picture of implementations, use cases and critical success factors of big data projects.<br /><br /><br /><br />So now you are a junior data scientist, what&rsquo;s next?<br />At this point you should be able to take a blank slate, setup a big data environment, ingest data, execute useful analytics and provide a presentation layer to any organisation you are at.<br />The next step is to continue deepening your knowledge, the focus is then put on advanced statistics, graph theory, advanced data structures, streaming analytics and finally we move into the Probabilistic Modelling and Deep Learning.<br /><br />Once you have proven competency, a solid track record and a vast breadth and depth of knowledge, at this point you are considered a Data Scientist.<br /><br /><br />As the industry becomes more established, we expect to see this path to Data Scientist becoming more commonplace. At Entelect, we use the roadmap to ensure our Data Scientists are true craftsmen in their field and can consistently provide the highest quality service and solutions to their clients at all times.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;For many years, loyalty in the business environment was measured by tenure or resignations. However, this is the age of the fluid workforce. That which motivates Millennials to stay or leave a company is driven by many things, several which are largely out of the hands of HR managers. Unless they reframe their understanding of loyalty. Says Yatish Parshotam, Chief People Officer, Entelect.\n  \n  \n The baby boomer generation tended to stay in one job for their entire working career. My dad is a great example of this having been a shipping manager for a company for 25 years. His previous job was for 15 years. In neither job, did he receive fancy perks or bonuses, there were no &lsquo;pause&rsquo; areas or coffee machines.\n  \n However, fast forward to the Millennials workforce and we&rsquo;re seeing a dramatic shift in the mind-sets of our employees. The pace of employee needs and demands in the workplace has changed. Along with their expectations of management. For some while, the phrase &lsquo;people leave their managers not the company&rsquo; may have been true, but it does not sufficiently address the reason for leaving.\n  \n According to a recent industry surveys,\n &bull; 29% of millennials are engaged at work, 16% are actively disengaged, 55% are not engaged (gallup)\n &bull; 21% of millennials say they've changed jobs within the past year, more than 3x the number of non-millennials (gallup)\n &bull; 44% of Millennials say, if given the choice, they expect to leave their current employers in the next two years (deloitte)\n  \n Many companies today have adopted new policies and practices to provide an environment that supports and encourages Millennials. There are great work opportunities, succession planning, well-defined growth paths, autonomy, health programmes, training and mentorship. But employees still leave. Why?\n  \n Does this mean that employees today are not loyal or, should we be redefining our definition of loyalty? Our reality is that we live in an age of a Fluid workforce so can loyalty still exist and if so, what drives loyalty in this environment? In my opinion, employee engagement is one of the key factors.\n  \n Typically, people leave because there is a deeper cultural misalignment with the company. Companies need to recognize that loyalty is a two-way street. That means not only providing employees with growth and development opportunities but also taking the time to engage with them personally and understand their aspirations. This is most authentic when the support offered is entirely selfless. Sometimes, that means encouraging people to follow their passions even if that means they move out of your organization.\n  \n The reality is people will leave. That is the nature of today&rsquo;s fluid workforce. However, loyalty is something that begins within the organisation, but it could reach far beyond the four walls of your business.\n  \n When people leave our company, they do so for many reasons, some of which are personal and, which no counter-offer can address. But if that person knew there was an authentic, selfless interest in their personal development and growth, then they will remain loyal to your company beyond their duration with you. Because employees who move on, do so with the value you&rsquo;ve contributed to them.\n  \n For the past three years, Entelect have participated in the Deloitte Best Company Survey. This past year, our results reflected some of this thinking, specifically around building loyalty with employees in a way that reaches beyond the four walls of this business:\n  \n &bull; 93% of respondents felt that in the last year they&rsquo;d had the opportunity to grow and learn\n &bull; 94% of employees believed that this company cares about developing people for long-term careers, not just the current job\n &bull; 95% said they could identify with the values of the organization, and\n &bull; 94% said there is a feeling of trust throughout the organisation\n  \n  \n In real terms, practices that achieve results like these means your employees will likely continue to be your brand ambassador beyond their time with you. And that they will do so out of a genuine appreciation for the value you have contributed to their growth. They may wish to return to your company, provide high quality referrals or, you may find that strategic business partnerships emerge that could have far reaching benefits for the future.\n  \n In my role, working for a software engineering company, my greatest excitement comes from not only helping people grow in their roles but as people in their personal lives as well. When they move on, their relationship with our organization remains strong because of the value we have contributed to them professionally, and personally.\n  \n Companies must demonstrate loyalty to their employees by treating and investing in them as though they will be with you forever. You will never be able to control the market; competitor hiring strategies, economic downturns, or consumer trends. But if you focus on the individuals, your company will be far stronger.\n  \n Engage with your employees on a personal level and selflessly put their growth first. This is where loyalty starts. But there is no reason loyalty should end here. Employees valued in this way will remain loyal to your organization for a very long time and the relationship could grow into something more than either of you expected.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The importance of socialization at work&quot;}">The importance of socialization at work</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;What is the purpose of socialization? For many years, socialization in the workplace was a way to help employees &lsquo;let their hair down&rsquo; after a long week. Friday night bar or braai was a way to give back to employees. But company culture is going through a transition. Employees now expect more connectedness with their company.\n  \n According to Professor Matthew Lieberman, human interaction is a basic human need, which he equates to our need for food and shelter. &ldquo;Being socially connected is our brains lifelong passion&rdquo; says Prof Lieberman. As such, socialization has several purposes and outcomes which should not be dismissed when we shift into a business environment.\n  \n The simple truth is that fostering friendships at work helps employee engagement. It creates a positive environment where employees feel connected and can develop a sense of purpose with their peers.\n  \n Often, socialization takes place within obvious groups such as project teams. But it should also be encouraged across traditional business boundaries to help stimulate a sense of connectedness with the company.\n  \n Boundaries can be created around teams, hierarchical groups, personal interest groups or career goals. Sometimes they are obvious, sometimes far less apparent. But socialization is something that can traverse any boundary; a junior to a senior on another team, two people striving for promotions in different sectors, or weekend interests.\n  \n However, developing communities isn&rsquo;t easy. It requires a company to provide platforms and environments that support and promote relationship building. This isn&rsquo;t just Friday night bar, although those kind of events does serve a purpose. The initiatives must be part of a bigger strategic, thought-through, program to promote relationship building across various &lsquo;boundaries&rsquo;.\n  \n  \n What should be the true intent of Socialization?\n  \n The true intent of socialization is two-fold; to create camaraderie which serves to drive accountability and delivery in the work place, but also employee engagement which leads to job satisfaction and a sense of personal fulfillment.\n  \n However, these goals can fall apart if the company in question does not appreciate that relationships are not merely a means to an end, but an end in itself; one that must be authentic.\n  \n Camaraderie is a key feature of a successful team because it creates a sense of mutual accountability and responsibility. Employees who have a sense of accountability, responsibility, and self-fulfillment are more likely to stay engaged in the workplace. Hence it can logically be considered to have a positive effect on retention, as these features relate to personal development.\n So, what should your company do to promote community and socialization?\n  \n Without knowing it, socialization starts on your first day; introductions, onboarding. Already there is a connection made in those first few hours and days as people get to know each other.\n  \n Then there are the connections made as people join project teams and begin to integrate themselves into roles and take on responsibilities. However, very often, this is where socialization begins to fade. The pressures of the project deadlines mean that work becomes the focus and socialization quickly moves to second place.\n  \n One should realize that socialization is an ongoing practice that never ends. Once you&rsquo;ve settled into your team, there are opportunities to socialize with new employees, or form a relationship with your client, which leads to more opportunities to socialize and engage with clients from different departments.\n  \n Although after work drinks can be a great social tool in its simplest form, relationship building at work serves the greater purpose of providing personal and professional support.\n  \n Companies must spend considerable thinking time dedicated to establishing various and multiple social opportunities. In some instances, this may feature as part of an appraisal or a less formal growth objective, where the employee makes a considerable effort to attend the social activities or even manage arrange the social activities.\n  \n Non-traditional examples of socialization initiatives include community events such as User Groups and Entelect&rsquo;s DevDay. Social investment initiatives, such as the Entelect Foundation, or sports events are more typical activities that companies such as Entelect use to help break down traditional boundaries in the work place and encourage their staff to create relationships across teams, projects or hierarchies.\n  \n At Entelect the Social Clubs are run by employees, where they have full ownership and autonomy of their clubs.\n  \n Take the mountain climbing club for example. They meet once a month whereby the venue will either be indoor or outdoor and the tools required for climbing are sponsored by Entelect. A typical day would include 10-20 people including the spouse or plus 1. Then you have a good 3-4 hours of community building, cross-team teamwork and support for their fellow climbers. The day after the event, pictures are shared on the internal social platform and plenty of jokes and chatter around the day and events as they transpired.\n  \n Socialization however, is also very personal. Some people prefer to socialize in large groups where there is lots of energy such as the climbing club. Whereas other people prefer to socialize in small groups or one-on-one. Companies need to find ways to support and facilitate these different connecting styles, otherwise company culture will become exclusive rather than inclusive, which is ultimately the goal.\n  \n A good example of a way to engage with people who prefer smaller groups is to invite a fellow employee from a different team on a coffee run. Or to join the Chess Club at Entelect, where they meet bi-monthly. These interactions present less social pressure and can often result in making a stronger connection as it&rsquo;s one-on-one.\n  \n Given the importance of socialization, many companies should make sure that it is a key part of their culture. Whenever someone asks me, why do I drive the social culture in a company as much as much as I do, my response always comes down to the following; One-third or more of your day are spent at the office. You can just as well build relationships and community, as it is so much more fulfilling in your working environment when you collaborate and feel that you belong.\n  \n Employees expectation of companies is most certainly shifting, and companies need to view an employees desire to belong as positive. While this places a few extra demands on a company to ensure they are providing relationship development opportunities for every type of personality, they must remember that creating camaraderie in the workplace and improving employee engagement will lead to job satisfaction and a sense of personal fulfillment for everyone in the workplace.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I built an oscilloscope the other day. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m going to do with it but the point is that I built it and, in doing so, I learnt a few things, including how to present information meaningfully on a small device, which is becoming more relevant in the field of software development.\n For a few hours, I was out of my comfort zone but I was learning, researching and understanding new concepts. The fact that I had an oscilloscope to show for it was a bonus but what really mattered was the journey of creating something, of problem-solving, and that incomparable sense of achievement when it was finally finished. Even if it was 3am and I knew the kids would be looking for breakfast in a few hours.\n This process of learning and creating got me thinking about leadership in the fast-moving technology space. In the new age, our comfort zone is the danger zone, and if we don&rsquo;t occasionally step out of the boundaries of what we know, it&rsquo;s impossible to stay relevant and to keep our finger on the pulse of this dynamic industry.\n Get comfortable with being uncomfortable\n Too often, managers get bogged down by administrative tasks, performance reviews and growing the business. While this is important because it keeps our heads above the trees, we also risk losing touch with the industry because we can&rsquo;t see the wood for those trees.\n Learning is one of the driving cultural principles at Entelect. It&rsquo;s how we increase our value to our peers, colleagues and clients. It&rsquo;s how we find new and novel approaches to problems and services. But most importantly, it&rsquo;s how we stay relevant in our field.\n Learning forces you to think outside of the boundaries of what you deal with on a daily basis, exposing you to new technologies and industries, and giving you an opportunity to apply your knowledge and systems to other problems.\n Colour outside the lines\n Managers often reach a level where engagement with junior staff, potential and existing clients, and the industry as a whole is not possible because their focus is on business development.\n But what if I told you that the business development we strive for is just on the outside of our comfort zone? It&rsquo;s on the ground, among the coders who are deploying systems and meeting deadlines; it&rsquo;s on social media, connecting with people who share your passion for home automation and can help you figure out why your swimming pool light won&rsquo;t turn off automatically. It&rsquo;s in the audience at a Bitcoin conference, even though you work for an environmental NGO.\n By spending time on site, managers not only get a chance to see what coders are working on and to get a better appreciation of the challenges they face, but they also have an opportunity to connect, to share ideas and knowledge, and to identify opportunities to do things differently or to elevate a task to become a standard. By pulling ideas from the learner, the hobbyist and the person in the delivery stream, managers will instinctively know how and where to grow the business.\n The new comfort zone for managers is not behind a desk, it&rsquo;s on the ground, fetching coffee and pizza while the team works towards deadlines. It&rsquo;s among the coders and tinkerers at user groups and dev days. It&rsquo;s attending industry conferences on topics we know little about. It&rsquo;s engaging on social media, forming relationships with like-minded people and building trust.\n Technology changes rapidly. Getting comfortable with the way things are and by only operating within the boundaries of our business is dangerous territory and puts us on a fast-track to irrelevancy. But by engaging, learning, sharing, having an opinion and finding a creative outlet, we earn the trust and respect of our colleagues and clients, and there&rsquo;s no substitute for that in the professional services industry. You might end up with a pile of useless oscilloscopes, but I promise the journey of getting there will be worth it.\n Now, excuse me while I figure out how to automate my swimming pool light before the kids wake up for breakfast.&quot;}">

It&rsquo;s on the ground, among the coders who are deploying systems and meeting deadlines; it&rsquo;s on social media, connecting with people who share your passion for home automation and can help you figure out why your swimming pool light won&rsquo;t turn off automatically. It&rsquo;s in the audience at a Bitcoin conference, even though you work for an environmental NGO.<br />By spending time on site, managers not only get a chance to see what coders are working on and to get a better appreciation of the challenges they face, but they also have an opportunity to connect, to share ideas and knowledge, and to identify opportunities to do things differently or to elevate a task to become a standard. By pulling ideas from the learner, the hobbyist and the person in the delivery stream, managers will instinctively know how and where to grow the business.<br />The new comfort zone for managers is not behind a desk, it&rsquo;s on the ground, fetching coffee and pizza while the team works towards deadlines. It&rsquo;s among the coders and tinkerers at user groups and dev days. It&rsquo;s attending industry conferences on topics we know little about. It&rsquo;s engaging on social media, forming relationships with like-minded people and building trust.<br />Technology changes rapidly. Getting comfortable with the way things are and by only operating within the boundaries of our business is dangerous territory and puts us on a fast-track to irrelevancy. But by engaging, learning, sharing, having an opinion and finding a creative outlet, we earn the trust and respect of our colleagues and clients, and there&rsquo;s no substitute for that in the professional services industry. You might end up with a pile of useless oscilloscopes, but I promise the journey of getting there will be worth it.<br />Now, excuse me while I figure out how to automate my swimming pool light before the kids wake up for breakfast.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;For many software engineers, there comes a time when they must decide whether to remain technical or pursue a role that primarily requires managing others. They are no longer solely responsible for their own contributions, but also that of others and the team as a whole. The transition to 'manager of others' must certainly be one of the more stressful milestones in one&rsquo;s career - a hypothesis partly supported by the numerous articles online on this topic.\n However, very little is said from the perspective of those responsible for promoting an individual into a leadership role. What are some of the common challenges and fears facing new managers, and what can leaders of leaders do to support them during the transition?\n  \n Areas of discomfort for new managers\n  \n Software engineers &mdash; especially the high achievers, those most likely to be promoted into a leadership role &mdash; are natural &lsquo;yes&rsquo; people, willing to take on a new challenge without always knowing what&rsquo;s on the other side of the door. There is plenty to debate about whether moving into a management position is indeed a step-up on the career ladder, but let&rsquo;s assume it&rsquo;s happening, and for the right reasons.\n  \n Influence over control\n The most notable adjustment is shifting from a position of control to a position of influence. As a &lsquo;doer&rsquo; of the work, you are in direct control of what you&rsquo;re building. Your responsibilities are task oriented, hands-on, and your actions have an immediate and tangible effect on your output.\n As a manager of others, your job is to influence. Leadership style plays a large part in your effectiveness as a manager, and often requires the new manager to cede a significant level of control of how the job gets done.\n  \n Losing technical skills\n Spending more time managing delivery and team members naturally takes away time from being able to practice the technical skills that have been part of your technical career until now. This is a real fear many new managers face &mdash; their livelihood has been anchored on these technical skills for most, if not all, of their career up until this point. Addressing this fear is important to avoid regret later down the line.\n  \n Holding others to account\n Giving constructive feedback to others, both positive and negative, is something that many new managers can find extremely uncomfortable. It takes part skill and part courage and includes holding others to account for not meeting expectations.\n  \n Priorities, time management and context switching\n Technical individuals will naturally gravitate towards technical tasks since this is where they feel most comfortable. They have a high level of confidence that they will succeed, and believe that technical tasks is where their time is best spent. Plus, there is a common misconception that time not spent designing a solution or writing code is time wasted. However, this also happens to require larger chunks of focus time, which is a luxury that managers don&rsquo;t always have. So, the ability to prioritize what&rsquo;s important and context switch appropriately in the new role is a common challenge faced by most new managers.\n  \n Dealing with imprecise elements\n Software engineers are used to binary outcomes: it either works or it doesn&rsquo;t, and the timeframes for feedback on these outcomes in the software world are fairly instant. As a manager, the focus shifts from binary outcomes to one of motivating others, building relationships, making decisions with limited information and planning more than one or two sprints ahead. New managers from a technical background often struggle to adjust to making long-view decisions, especially with imperfect information.\n  \n  \n Supporting the transition to management\n  \n It&rsquo;s easy to assume an individual who excelled in a technical role will naturally perform at a similar level in a leadership role, especially if they are career driven, enthusiastic, and eager to take on new challenges. Ideally they&rsquo;ve been operating with some or all of these responsibilities before taking full accountability, but this isn&rsquo;t always practical given the current demand for both technical and leadership skills in the software development world. What can we do as leaders of leaders to better support them in their new role?\n  \n First be a mentor, then a boss\n Software engineers come from a learning process of reading books, doing online courses, experimenting with code and tools and on the job experiences. A large part of their growth comes from interacting with other team members discussing technical designs and the merits of one approach over another. The soft skills required for a leadership role cannot easily be digested through the same learning approach. Providing a hands-on, mentorship role during the early stages can help guide in ways that cannot be found in a text book, or through formal job descriptions and performance appraisals.\n  \n Set proper boundaries\n New managers often struggle with knowing what decisions they can and cannot make. Make the boundaries of the role explicit and give permission to make mistakes. Encourage them to continue developing their technical skills through various means, but be clear that a key focus of the role is growing and developing others. Talk through the challenges of time management and get them to commit an appropriate amount of time in the right areas, especially those outside their comfort zone.\n  \n Teach them how to give effective feedback\n Just as you expect a new manager to hold others to account, do the same for them &mdash; lead by example and show first-hand how to give effective feedback to team members. Spend time in feedback sessions, preparing discussion points and suitable techniques for dealing with potentially difficult discussions, and doing retrospectives on how various scenarios could have been tackled differently.\n  \n Let go\n If you&rsquo;re promoting someone in an area you&rsquo;ve directly been responsible for in the past, give them the space to find their own leadership style. Don&rsquo;t micro-manage. In the same way you&rsquo;re guiding them to trust their team, trust the new manager to decide how to achieve his or her own objectives.\n  \n Develop management skills, emphasize leadership\n There are a broad range of skills to master to become an effective manager. The one area of development that will benefit the new manager the most is leadership. Teaching them how to influence and develop others in a manner that builds trust and strong relationships will go further than any other skill.\n  \n  \n New managers can experience a significant amount of discomfort and stress when moving from a technical to a management role, which may not manifest immediately. If they&rsquo;re taking on this new role and staying with their current team and environment, be sure to explain their new responsibilities to both team and client. Having a suitable strategy in place to support an individual during this transition can go a long way in helping them be the best leader they can be.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Six leadership activities to sustain high-performance software teams&quot;}">Six leadership activities to sustain high-performance software teams</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;High Performing Teams (HPTs) are the pinnacle of many businesses today. This is especially true in the software space, where competition for talent and skills is prominent. HPTs are those that take on a life of their own and are largely self-sustaining (10 Leadership Techniques). However, this doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Teams can only be self-sustaining if they&rsquo;re operating in an environment that fosters certain leadership features.\n  \n Successful leaders build their teams around one simple goal: to create a space where people are charged with energy, can thrive, have a sense of belonging, and love to work as a team (Forbes).\n In the software industry, the pressure to deliver flawless software craftsmanship is intense. As such, building HPTs is essential, but sustaining those teams and ensuring job satisfaction and the promise of meaningful work is what can keep a solid team together and delivering consistently.\n  \n Here are six activities leaders can perform to create these spaces to help sustain their HPTs:\n  \n  \n 1. Set goals for individuals and the team as a whole\n  \n Once you&rsquo;ve built an HPT, it's important to understand that, in order for the team to remain so, it&rsquo;s best to adopt iterative processes &ndash; with each new project, deadline or team member. Using team goal frameworks can help you identify areas for improvement and, ultimately, lead to growth and increased job satisfaction.\n  \n Our team has had great success using good ol&rsquo; SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Conducting individual SWOT analyses and discussing each team member&rsquo;s personal analysis provides a better idea of perceptions in the team and where energy should be focused: It can be informative to see how people interpret their own situations. Using this in my own team has helped me identify areas to improve team dynamics.\n  \n Another well-known framework is SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely) goals. Develop SMART goals collaboratively with your team to build inclusive objectives. Your team's goals need to be in the back of everyone's mind, whether you reiterate your goals in stand-ups, display progress on a dashboard or communicate them regularly. Keep track of people's goals and SWOT analyses as this will form the backbone for planning their personal development and guide performance conversations. At Entelect, we have an internal platform I use for capturing conversations like this, but Google Docs or Evernote also work well.\n  \n  \n 2. Articulate and share your strategy\n  \n Share your strategy with the team. This is often overlooked in favour of goals, but goals are not strategies. Goals define the destination; strategies define the path taken, trade-offs and unique activities involved in executing a plan to reach your goals. Sharing strategy includes the team in a joint vision to strive towards and may help in increasing motivation and accountability to achieve a higher goal. Understanding the twists and turns involved in following a strategy also provides team members with added meaning in their work, which in turn stimulates job satisfaction.\n  \n Often, technical teams are the last ones to hear about new innovations, products or integrations in their pipeline. If you want the choir to sing on pitch, get everyone's buy-in and follow a unified strategy. It&rsquo;s no secret that leaders can grow and retain great people by helping them have their say about the company or product&rsquo;s long-term vision. Sometimes, the most unexpected people have the most awe-inspiring input to give.\n  \n  \n 3. Optimise operational efficiency\n  \n Operational efficiency is key to executing your strategy. But operational efficiencies are not static processes. They too are iterative and require constant review and diagnosis. There are a few areas where you can help to optimise general operations. Positive changes to these areas will help create a space where people can focus on their strengths and grow.\n  \n On-boarding\n  \n On-boarding can be one of the best ways to create a good first impression in any team environment. In an HPT, the on-boarding process must convert new team members into fully functioning team members as quickly as possible.\n  \n Some of the essential activities for new members of High Performing Teams are:\n  \n  Becoming comfortable working together and accomplishing tasks with minimal hand-holding.\n Communicating well in the team and utilising their tools and practices.\n Picking up the business domain relatively quickly and interacting with key stakeholders with confidence.\n   \n Consider using tools to help your new teammate progress through their on-boarding, such as a Trello board (here). My team and I introduced an on-boarding process using Trello at one of our big corporate clients where we on-board 30-plus people throughout the year. It helped us keep track of where our team members are at and quickly see if someone needs help.\n  \n Knowledge sharing\n  \n Centralised and structured knowledge sharing greatly improves productivity and efficiency. In larger companies and teams, you often find a lot of duplicated efforts because of weak or non-existent knowledge-sharing facilities or practices. Be sure to share standards and tools used across the company and team to reduce rework and build on solid foundations contributed by others.\n  \n We have used wikis to great success to create ad hoc specification, document startup guides for developers and business analysts, share nifty SQL scripts, document go-to guys and business owners in our teams and partners - pretty much anything that would be of value for someone else, we try and offload here.\n  \n Instill the values in your team to look after their collective knowledge and you&rsquo;ll add to their sense of job satisfaction and help sustain the level of quality delivery and pace that an HPT is renowned for.\n  \n Communication\n  \n Provide high-bandwidth, low-latency communication tools. High-bandwidth communication channels allow a great amount of information to be transferred between parties but often have long delays associated with it. Email is a prime example of this. Low-latency communication channels allow for quick turnaround times.\n  \n Help your team to find a balance and the tools to improve the quality of communication. Recently, our team had the opportunity to work closely with teams on different continents and in different timezones. With this new challenge, we had to re-evaluate our communication tools to promote shorter feedback loops and provide an adequate level of detail.\n  \n Process and red tape\n  \n Rigid and formal rules can kill a team&rsquo;s productivity. Eliminate processes that diminish your team&rsquo;s autonomy and authority. This definitely speaks to the agilist in that you need to value people over process. Put principles in place that allow people to adapt quickly and deliver quality.\n  \n  \n 4. Empower people to make decisions\n  \n Many business leaders overestimate their abilities to build teams and make decisions for them. If you fail to realise that you should not be the centre of all decision making, you will never be able to retain HPTs.\n  \n Create an environment for growth and empowerment. Empowerment means giving people the means and mandate to make more decisions that influence their work on a daily basis.\n  \n Leaders often mistake their roles as being the ones who direct the daily operations and tasks that get dished out to team members. But true leaders create an environment where other forms of leadership can emerge organically and flourish. Nurture and encourage leadership of all kinds.\n  \n Here are some basic rules for empowering your team members:\n  \n 1. It should always be incremental - Don't dump someone in a situation that could be overwhelming.\n 2. There should be appropriate control in place - Facilitate and moderate appropriately.\n 3. Replace control with accountability - as ability increases, loosen your control and hand over responsibility AND accountability. There is no responsibility without accountability.\n  \n  \n 5. Apply situational leadership techniques\n  \n There is a wide range of leadership styles and almost everyone possesses leadership qualities that can be tapped into. One way to look at these leadership styles is to classify them according to their strengths in the three components outlined by Gerald M. Weinberg in &ldquo;Becoming a technical leader&rdquo;:\n  \n Motivational leadership - a leader who can motivate a team due to his or her technical ability.\n  \n Organisational leadership - a leader who can help create an environment for the team to perform at a high level (think tools, processes, mentorship and culture)\n  \n Innovation leadership - a leader who controls the flow of new ideas and encourages innovation.\n  \n Juggling these styles, given the situation and individuals at hand, can give your team the edge it needs to outperform. We have a handful of extremely talented and technical-minded developers in our team. Giving them the opportunity to lead our initiatives on a technical front has enabled us to adopt new technologies quickly, with the confidence that our top guys and girls have approved the team&rsquo;s move.\n  \n  \n 6. Promote constant learning and improvement\n  \n Individual and team development plans can help you carve out a path for growing your team. Do you invest time, money and energy into your own people? Do you give them the same focus and attention you want them to provide your company?\n  \n The most important thing a leader can do for their team members is to facilitate continuous feedback. Promoting constant learning and improvement makes people more likely to stay on board and engaged; remaining loyal and helping your company on its journey. The threat of people leaving your organisation will always be there. However, the key is to make a concerted effort to invest in each employee and make them feel like a valuable, indispensable asset (while they&rsquo;re there). Spend time with them, nurture them, and watch as the magic happens.\n  \n These six leadership activities all include constant review and diagnosis. Nothing can be static. An HPT can only be sustained if it is constantly evolving. Fostering the values outlined here will not only build High Performance Teams but also increase retention. These practices may seem daunting to implement, but start to incorporate them, one-by-one, in your team. Remember, small steps add up to big improvements over time.\n  \n Perhaps ask yourself, what vital principles, practices or values have your teams benefitted from most?&quot;}">

<div>High Performing Teams (HPTs) are the pinnacle of many businesses today. This is especially true in the software space, where competition for talent and skills is prominent. HPTs are those that take on a life of their own and are largely self-sustaining (10 Leadership Techniques). However, this doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident. Teams can only be self-sustaining if they&rsquo;re operating in an environment that fosters certain leadership features.<br /><br />Successful leaders build their teams around one simple goal: to create a space where people are charged with energy, can thrive, have a sense of belonging, and love to work as a team (Forbes).<br />In the software industry, the pressure to deliver flawless software craftsmanship is intense. As such, building HPTs is essential, but sustaining those teams and ensuring job satisfaction and the promise of meaningful work is what can keep a solid team together and delivering consistently.<br /><br />Here are six activities leaders can perform to create these spaces to help sustain their HPTs:<br /><br /><br />1. Set goals for individuals and the team as a whole<br /><br />Once you&rsquo;ve built an HPT, it's important to understand that, in order for the team to remain so, it&rsquo;s best to adopt iterative processes &ndash; with each new project, deadline or team member. Using team goal frameworks can help you identify areas for improvement and, ultimately, lead to growth and increased job satisfaction.<br /><br />Our team has had great success using good ol&rsquo; SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Conducting individual SWOT analyses and discussing each team member&rsquo;s personal analysis provides a better idea of perceptions in the team and where energy should be focused: It can be informative to see how people interpret their own situations. Using this in my own team has helped me identify areas to improve team dynamics.<br /><br />Another well-known framework is SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely) goals. Develop SMART goals collaboratively with your team to build inclusive objectives. Your team's goals need to be in the back of everyone's mind, whether you reiterate your goals in stand-ups, display progress on a dashboard or communicate them regularly. Keep track of people's goals and SWOT analyses as this will form the backbone for planning their personal development and guide performance conversations. At Entelect, we have an internal platform I use for capturing conversations like this, but Google Docs or Evernote also work well.<br /><br /><br />2. Articulate and share your strategy<br /><br />Share your strategy with the team. This is often overlooked in favour of goals, but goals are not strategies. Goals define the destination; strategies define the path taken, trade-offs and unique activities involved in executing a plan to reach your goals. Sharing strategy includes the team in a joint vision to strive towards and may help in increasing motivation and accountability to achieve a higher goal. Understanding the twists and turns involved in following a strategy also provides team members with added meaning in their work, which in turn stimulates job satisfaction.<br /><br />Often, technical teams are the last ones to hear about new innovations, products or integrations in their pipeline. If you want the choir to sing on pitch, get everyone's buy-in and follow a unified strategy. It&rsquo;s no secret that leaders can grow and retain great people by helping them have their say about the company or product&rsquo;s long-term vision. Sometimes, the most unexpected people have the most awe-inspiring input to give.<br /><br /><br />3. Optimise operational efficiency<br /><br />Operational efficiency is key to executing your strategy. But operational efficiencies are not static processes. They too are iterative and require constant review and diagnosis. There are a few areas where you can help to optimise general operations. Positive changes to these areas will help create a space where people can focus on their strengths and grow.<br /><br />On-boarding<br /><br />On-boarding can be one of the best ways to create a good first impression in any team environment. In an HPT, the on-boarding process must convert new team members into fully functioning team members as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Some of the essential activities for new members of High Performing Teams are:<br /><br />Becoming comfortable working together and accomplishing tasks with minimal hand-holding.<br />Communicating well in the team and utilising their tools and practices.<br />Picking up the business domain relatively quickly and interacting with key stakeholders with confidence.<br /><br />Consider using tools to help your new teammate progress through their on-boarding, such as a Trello board (here). My team and I introduced an on-boarding process using Trello at one of our big corporate clients where we on-board 30-plus people throughout the year. It helped us keep track of where our team members are at and quickly see if someone needs help.<br /><br />Knowledge sharing<br /><br />Centralised and structured knowledge sharing greatly improves productivity and efficiency. In larger companies and teams, you often find a lot of duplicated efforts because of weak or non-existent knowledge-sharing facilities or practices. Be sure to share standards and tools used across the company and team to reduce rework and build on solid foundations contributed by others.<br /><br />We have used wikis to great success to create ad hoc specification, document startup guides for developers and business analysts, share nifty SQL scripts, document go-to guys and business owners in our teams and partners - pretty much anything that would be of value for someone else, we try and offload here.<br /><br />Instill the values in your team to look after their collective knowledge and you&rsquo;ll add to their sense of job satisfaction and help sustain the level of quality delivery and pace that an HPT is renowned for.<br /><br />Communication<br /><br />Provide high-bandwidth, low-latency communication tools. High-bandwidth communication channels allow a great amount of information to be transferred between parties but often have long delays associated with it. Email is a prime example of this. Low-latency communication channels allow for quick turnaround times.<br /><br />Help your team to find a balance and the tools to improve the quality of communication. Recently, our team had the opportunity to work closely with teams on different continents and in different timezones. With this new challenge, we had to re-evaluate our communication tools to promote shorter feedback loops and provide an adequate level of detail.<br /><br />Process and red tape<br /><br />Rigid and formal rules can kill a team&rsquo;s productivity. Eliminate processes that diminish your team&rsquo;s autonomy and authority. This definitely speaks to the agilist in that you need to value people over process. Put principles in place that allow people to adapt quickly and deliver quality.<br /><br /><br />4. Empower people to make decisions<br /><br />Many business leaders overestimate their abilities to build teams and make decisions for them. If you fail to realise that you should not be the centre of all decision making, you will never be able to retain HPTs.<br /><br />Create an environment for growth and empowerment. Empowerment means giving people the means and mandate to make more decisions that influence their work on a daily basis.<br /><br />Leaders often mistake their roles as being the ones who direct the daily operations and tasks that get dished out to team members.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;In an industry where teams have been dominated by Millennials for several years, this may be the first time many of our colleagues have to deal with a new generation in the workplace.

However, Gen Z are also the offspring of Gen X, and it&rsquo;s clear to see how the attitudes of the parents have shaped Gen Z.\n  \n Gen Z will be the first generation to never have known a world without smartphones and social media. Access to technology will be taken for granted by many people in this age group. Platforms such as Facebook are being ditched in favour of Instagram and Snapchat and the rise of &ldquo;finsta&rdquo; (fake or friends only) and &ldquo;rinsta&rdquo; (real) accounts shows that users understand the possible long-term ramifications of social media. Not only might your parents find out what you have been doing but, in years to come you might miss out on that varsity place or get denied your chosen job based on posts made years before.\n  \n The way we consume information continues to evolve with Gen Z; attention spans continue to diminish it seems, so information delivery and interaction with systems need to be bite-sized, quick and to the point. Micro-apps, which offer targeted interaction to do certain tasks, are coming to the fore and these reinforce the bite-sized culture.\n  \n Moving forwards, employees will not want to engage with large enterprise systems through one app interface that is complex to learn. Instead, highly focused interaction points will let people do what they need with minimum friction.\n  \n Education and culture shift\n My opinion is that this approach will spill over into education, where I feel the value of traditional three- or four-year degrees will be put under even more pressure in the next 10 to 20 years. In IT especially, the speed of change means that developers are frequently asked to cross-skill into new areas. Learning is becoming a career-long reality for developers and is something employers need to embrace fully.\n  \n With Gen X parents, who have engaged with their children in a mature fashion, we&rsquo;ll be faced with new colleagues who will be confident and independent. Leadership of Gen Z-ers must focus on collaboration and mutual respect. Hierarchy does not work; this generation firmly believes that they have something to offer and that even people with more experience can still learn from them.\n  \n Attracting born-frees\n Generation Z accounts for nearly a third of the world&rsquo;s population, with the majority of them living in underdeveloped or developing countries. From a South African perspective, it is likely that our workforce will ultimately carry a greater percentage of Gen Z-ers than many of the developed Western economies.\n  \n As the first complete generation to be &lsquo;born-free&rsquo;, Gen Z in South Africa will be the most culturally diverse generation we have seen. It&rsquo;s difficult to find research into the attitudes of black Gen Z software developers in South Africa; however, my feeling is that, as the most globally connected generation yet &ndash; and with IT skills in short supply in many countries across the globe &ndash; the possibility is that the current &lsquo;brain drain&rsquo; of software developers once they have a little experience is likely to continue into the next generation unless things change radically here in South Africa.\n  \n I&rsquo;ve worked for Entelect for over three years now and, being at the top end of the age profile, I can see how Entelect works hard to support social initiatives, provide clear career paths, incorporate and make use of social media and adopt flexible working practices.\n  \n Ultimately, we aim to cater for people on an individual basis and we take work-life balance very seriously. The fact that these efforts are all squarely aligned with stereotypical Millennial requirements is partly due to who we want to attract but also driven by who we already are.\n  \n Our current approach puts us in a good position to attract Generation Z workers as they, too, will want to work for a company that looks past simply making a profit to working somewhere that contributes to the wider society, working to be the best that we can and having fun while we do it.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;It&rsquo;s well accepted these days that the peer or code review is an important part of any development team&rsquo;s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

What below-the-surface decision making went down? We rarely get to peer behind the curtain to see an honest record of their journey. From dreaming and designing to budgeting, building and shipping and the complexities monetising their technology. Press-releases show the highlights, but they paper over the cracks and often obfuscate the real story.\n  \n I'll get to the point. Building software-defined technology products from an idea, is not as trivial as it might seem from the outside. With adequate planning, awareness and caution, almost all these risks can be mitigated and understood. Without them, the attraction can be a financially (and reputationally) dangerous trap. New technology businesses have potential for terrifying operational, legal, financial and skills-depth behind the veil, and these aren't the kinds of things you want to be learning about and tackling half-way through your execution, and your budget!\n  \n  \n Let's look at a widely known example, Uber.\n  \n A groundbreaking idea which is simple for anybody to grasp. The premise is to use a smartphone application to call a taxi to your location, which is conveniently available from the on-device GPS, take the ride, and then pay electronically. It is one of those ideas where we think to ourselves \&quot;why hasn't it been done before\&quot;. This is where it starts. When something sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Uber lost $1.46 billion in Q3 2017 alone, I wonder how many know that? It's not an exception either. The business lost more than a billion dollars in Q2, and $708 million in the first quarter. So where are all these costs coming from if Uber is just an app?!\n  \n There is a misconception for some of the less-technical among us that tech products are a scheme where the idea comprises everything. That the first-to-market wins and implementation doesn't need much attention. There is a blind-spot to other aspects of an application, website or technology which, while usually not deliberately ignored, are just not thought of.\n  \n In reality, there is hidden complexity in building a product, or a business, out of software beyond both the idea and the technical implementation. The purpose isto share and explore a few of the most common ones to invigorate your thought process.\n  \n  \n The complex areas to tackle when starting a business.\n  \n Costs: This is a tricky topic, primarily because of just how context-sensitive (and ambition-sensitive) costs can be. It is important to research the input, time and technology costs which might be applicable. Seemingly small details such as designs, third parties, lead-times, or where previously unknown components of a project (e.g. licensing, specialised tools and hosting) all introduce unplanned capital or operational budget impact. This information is powerful when negotiating, so doing the research, and gathering input from individuals or partners with experience should be one of the first steps taken.\n  \n Skills: Technology is supple and subjective, but even so, not all implementation teams are the same. Talented engineers, project managers, specialists and designers are very hard to find, this is evident by the rampant growth in demand for software engineers globally. For the same money and time, different teams will achieve vastly different results. This makes it important to research, network and take care when creating your own internal teams or outsourcing development. Technical and product teams need to be aligned, communicating freely with no loss of understanding, and share a common sense of direction, passion and urgency.\n  \n Operations: Once your app, website or service is built and launched, who will operate it? When customers have questions: who do they talk to? How do they contact them? How will you manage partners and third parties who have a role to play? Tech&rsquo; businesses still need a finance team and operational teams. People are still critical in the healthy functioning of any technology. Google has a search page which should be fully automated right? Type something in and some computers do the work and send back results. How many people could you possibly need? Google employed more than 70 000 staff in 2017.\n  \n Legal and compliance: Compliance is messy, and made worse by technologies that have to operate across borders and regulatory or legal jurisdictions. Around the world, governments have different laws regulating privacy, security and data. Seek advice here, explore previous examples and learn from them. This one is often left until last, whether out of priority or ignorance, and can delay a launch, cripple an idea or incur costly technology changes.\n  \n Time: Some things just take the fullness of time. Ideas need to settle, systems need to harden, team's need to storm and form, people need to build trust and feedback follows a cycle. Larger teams don't work proportionally faster (nine women cannot deliver a baby in one month!). Rushing blinds us, and can cause teams to make compromises they didn't fully understand. By no means is 'lethargic' a viable business strategy but sustainable pacing is. Iterating frequently and learning from failures are powerful tools in a product development arsenal.\n  \n Purity of vision: So much is made possible in a technology-based service or product, because it is malleable. Product owners can become trapped in paralysis, stuck between great ideas. Running too many tasks in parallel and never quite reaching a point of commercial or practical completion. This process can pull projects apart when even meaningful and independently brilliant ideas start to distract attention from a core vision. Something Twitter initially managed superbly.\n  \n These are the real threats, but there are more: preparing for scale, marketing, user experience, hosting and infrastructure, market research, technological possibilities, and more.\n  \n  \n Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly, managing these aspects doesn't actually need to cost more. So Lean Startup fans rejoice. A combination of foresight, avoiding certain expensive but avoidable emergencies, and methodical work typically result in a higher quality product.

Technology is a magical key which unlocks ideas and businesses in remarkable ways. Instead, the ambition is to encourage new product owners, entrepreneurs, analysts and project managers to go into these projects with more clarity, a bit more caution, and a better knowledge of the journey.\n  \n If starting a journey like this or developing an idea which could be the next big tech story, become informed, ask these questions and feel confident in your preparation to handle operational hurdles and legal arguments.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;By Tim Kroon (Entelect, COO) \n  \n To be upfront, it is not my intention to bestow sagely wisdom upon aspiring entrepreneurs and software professionals, rather I thought this would be a fun exploration of how business-endeavors in the realm of music could parallel some of what we see in the tech industry.\n  \n Presentation of credentials forthcoming:, in a former life I fronted a rock-band that toured South Africa for many years. We had some measure of success with local fans and radio but I can&rsquo;t say that we imprinted ourselves upon the zeitgeist. We put out a couple of records, worked with some great people and played a few hundred shows around the country. We didn't have a tour-bus, we had a tour-bakkie. But, there is something special about forming a band, defining a mission and embarking on it as a team and I hope you find some of these insights valuable if not entertaining.\n  \n  \n Fundamentals over fashion\n Good song writing is something that although on the surface appears to have changed dramatically over the decades, when you listen a little closer it is very much the same from the Beatles to Taylor Swift. A good song allows you to ignore all its imperfections and predictability because it grabs you with resonance - a combination of three characteristics: honesty, vulnerability and musicality. One of the reasons that U2 have been a mainstay for over 40 years is because of their commitment to this principle, they still bring stadiums of people to tears (happy tears for the fans, sad tears for the bono-haters) with the sounds of guitars, drums and voice.\n  \n When looking for advice on how to steer our products or businesses, you&rsquo;ll most certainly be met with pages and pages of neatly bulleted lists, littered with tech buzzwords and inspirational tokens like reinvention, disruption and innovation. Now I don&rsquo;t have a bad thing to say about innovation in the tech business, however I do question why it is always so high on our priority list when there are so many other more important problems we face. Some things that just as important as innovation are the fundamentals of on-time and quality service delivery, practical problem solving and honest, friendly customer service. My take on this one is become great at your core business before you try and change it.\n  \n  \n Perseverance is paramount\n I first heard Snow Patrol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Final Straw&rdquo; in my dorm room in 2002, and it was around 2005 that their music started hitting the international airwaves. You&rsquo;ll be surprised to hear that for a band that achieved such phenomenal global success at the time, they had been recording and touring for 12 years already, playing mostly in pubs and university campuses to a handful of people. Their 2005 release &ldquo;Eyes Open&rdquo; saw their situation change dramatically with support from a &lsquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rsquo; song placement, their album became an &ldquo;overnight success&rdquo;. There was nothing &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; about their success though and their story is not unique, it is shared by many other artists.\n  \n I haven&rsquo;t heard of a formula that makes success any easier to achieve, but I do know that those who have been successful, have had to stick it out for a while. Sure, there are elements to the success equation that are not entirely in our control, for example natural ability or talent is more a product of nature than it is anything else. This doesn&rsquo;t put those of us who aren&rsquo;t naturally gifted out of the running though, it just means that we may have to work a little harder and stay a little longer to get there. True, aspirational success is a rare confluence of opportunity, talent and circumstance. The longer you&rsquo;re in the game, the more likely you are to experience it. I see this with the exceptional individuals in our business and customers. There are so many different products, companies and technologies to work with out there in the market and it&rsquo;s hard to decide which horse to hitch your wagon to. It&rsquo;s harder to know when to leave and when to stay with your company, when to admit failure and move on with your venture. What I can say is this: make sure you&rsquo;re where you&rsquo;re meant to be, and when you are, put your faith in your team, company or colleagues and saddle in for the long haul.\n  \n  \n Ego is your enemy\n Out of check egos have been responsible for robbing us of many of our favourite bands over the years (Guns &lsquo;n Roses, The Police, Oasis to name only a few). It&rsquo;s easy to understand how emotions can get the better of you when you&rsquo;re being worshiped by thousands of people every night, and they all want a piece of you. I remember seeing Oasis live in 2009 and one of the magnetic aspects of their performance was Liam&rsquo;s obvious disdain for the audience. He was the true embodiment of a narcissistic rock-star and it was almost romantic. We wanted that from him, we paid for it. Liam&rsquo;s narcissism however was not just a performance, it was a disease which ended up destroying his relationship with his band and brother. Although, you have to admit that he's got a sense of humour about it. An excerpt from the book of Gallagher: \&quot;I suppose I do get sad, but not for too long. I just look in the mirror and go, &#96;What a (expletive) good-looking (expletive) you are.&#96; And then I brighten up.\&quot;\n  \n Self-confidence is attractive, and it builds confidence in the people we interact with. It&rsquo;s also healthy for us to respect our own opinions and methods. A good dose of it is absolutely necessary for success but be careful not to drink too deeply. Teams that exhibit a deeper sense of respect for each-other&rsquo;s contributions, opinions and personalities are far better equipped to weather the storm while those who succumb to ego and delusion will dissolve.\n  \n  \n Have fun, be interesting and break some stuff\n Rock bands remind us that it&rsquo;s important to question, break the rules and let loose from time to time. Whether it&rsquo;s punk, grunge, metal or pop, people are usually drawn to it for similar reasons. We want to know what it&rsquo;s like on the other side, to live a little vicariously, be a part of a movement and maybe even be reminded that we&rsquo;re in control of our own lives. And the industry needs examples and stories of risk-takers, rule-breakers and mad-men - people who push and test limits to show us what's possible. Legends, pariahs and martyrs who show us what we can, can&rsquo;t, should and shouldn&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m not advocating bat-biting (Ozzy Osbourne) or throwing grand pianos into hotel pools (Keith Moon), but the world would be a much duller place without them.\n  \n  \n To close with a quote from our very own industry, while discussing the prospect of Bitcoin&rsquo;s price reaching $500,000 in the next 3 years - McAfee &amp; Associates founder John McAfee said \&quot;If not, I will eat my own (insert part of male anatomy here) on national television\&quot;. Now there is someone who is willing to put more than their money where their mouth is.&quot;}">

<div>By Tim Kroon (Entelect, COO) <br /><br />To be upfront, it is not my intention to bestow sagely wisdom upon aspiring entrepreneurs and software professionals, rather I thought this would be a fun exploration of how business-endeavors in the realm of music could parallel some of what we see in the tech industry.<br /><br />Presentation of credentials forthcoming:, in a former life I fronted a rock-band that toured South Africa for many years. We had some measure of success with local fans and radio but I can&rsquo;t say that we imprinted ourselves upon the zeitgeist. We put out a couple of records, worked with some great people and played a few hundred shows around the country. We didn't have a tour-bus, we had a tour-bakkie. But, there is something special about forming a band, defining a mission and embarking on it as a team and I hope you find some of these insights valuable if not entertaining.<br /><br /><br />Fundamentals over fashion<br />Good song writing is something that although on the surface appears to have changed dramatically over the decades, when you listen a little closer it is very much the same from the Beatles to Taylor Swift. A good song allows you to ignore all its imperfections and predictability because it grabs you with resonance - a combination of three characteristics: honesty, vulnerability and musicality. One of the reasons that U2 have been a mainstay for over 40 years is because of their commitment to this principle, they still bring stadiums of people to tears (happy tears for the fans, sad tears for the bono-haters) with the sounds of guitars, drums and voice.<br /><br />When looking for advice on how to steer our products or businesses, you&rsquo;ll most certainly be met with pages and pages of neatly bulleted lists, littered with tech buzzwords and inspirational tokens like reinvention, disruption and innovation. Now I don&rsquo;t have a bad thing to say about innovation in the tech business, however I do question why it is always so high on our priority list when there are so many other more important problems we face. Some things that just as important as innovation are the fundamentals of on-time and quality service delivery, practical problem solving and honest, friendly customer service. My take on this one is become great at your core business before you try and change it.<br /><br /><br />Perseverance is paramount<br />I first heard Snow Patrol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Final Straw&rdquo; in my dorm room in 2002, and it was around 2005 that their music started hitting the international airwaves. You&rsquo;ll be surprised to hear that for a band that achieved such phenomenal global success at the time, they had been recording and touring for 12 years already, playing mostly in pubs and university campuses to a handful of people. Their 2005 release &ldquo;Eyes Open&rdquo; saw their situation change dramatically with support from a &lsquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rsquo; song placement, their album became an &ldquo;overnight success&rdquo;. There was nothing &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; about their success though and their story is not unique, it is shared by many other artists.<br /><br />I haven&rsquo;t heard of a formula that makes success any easier to achieve, but I do know that those who have been successful, have had to stick it out for a while. Sure, there are elements to the success equation that are not entirely in our control, for example natural ability or talent is more a product of nature than it is anything else. This doesn&rsquo;t put those of us who aren&rsquo;t naturally gifted out of the running though, it just means that we may have to work a little harder and stay a little longer to get there. True, aspirational success is a rare confluence of opportunity, talent and circumstance. The longer you&rsquo;re in the game, the more likely you are to experience it. I see this with the exceptional individuals in our business and customers. There are so many different products, companies and technologies to work with out there in the market and it&rsquo;s hard to decide which horse to hitch your wagon to. It&rsquo;s harder to know when to leave and when to stay with your company, when to admit failure and move on with your venture. What I can say is this: make sure you&rsquo;re where you&rsquo;re meant to be, and when you are, put your faith in your team, company or colleagues and saddle in for the long haul.<br /><br /><br />Ego is your enemy<br />Out of check egos have been responsible for robbing us of many of our favourite bands over the years (Guns &lsquo;n Roses, The Police, Oasis to name only a few). It&rsquo;s easy to understand how emotions can get the better of you when you&rsquo;re being worshiped by thousands of people every night, and they all want a piece of you. I remember seeing Oasis live in 2009 and one of the magnetic aspects of their performance was Liam&rsquo;s obvious disdain for the audience. He was the true embodiment of a narcissistic rock-star and it was almost romantic. We wanted that from him, we paid for it. Liam&rsquo;s narcissism however was not just a performance, it was a disease which ended up destroying his relationship with his band and brother. Although, you have to admit that he's got a sense of humour about it. An excerpt from the book of Gallagher: "I suppose I do get sad, but not for too long. I just look in the mirror and go, `What a (expletive) good-looking (expletive) you are.` And then I brighten up."<br /><br />Self-confidence is attractive, and it builds confidence in the people we interact with. It&rsquo;s also healthy for us to respect our own opinions and methods. A good dose of it is absolutely necessary for success but be careful not to drink too deeply. Teams that exhibit a deeper sense of respect for each-other&rsquo;s contributions, opinions and personalities are far better equipped to weather the storm while those who succumb to ego and delusion will dissolve.<br /><br /><br />Have fun, be interesting and break some stuff<br />Rock bands remind us that it&rsquo;s important to question, break the rules and let loose from time to time. Whether it&rsquo;s punk, grunge, metal or pop, people are usually drawn to it for similar reasons. We want to know what it&rsquo;s like on the other side, to live a little vicariously, be a part of a movement and maybe even be reminded that we&rsquo;re in control of our own lives. And the industry needs examples and stories of risk-takers, rule-breakers and mad-men - people who push and test limits to show us what's possible. Legends, pariahs and martyrs who show us what we can, can&rsquo;t, should and shouldn&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m not advocating bat-biting (Ozzy Osbourne) or throwing grand pianos into hotel pools (Keith Moon), but the world would be a much duller place without them.<br /><br /><br />To close with a quote from our very own industry, while discussing the prospect of Bitcoin&rsquo;s price reaching $500,000 in the next 3 years - McAfee &amp; Associates founder John McAfee said "If not, I will eat my own (insert part of male anatomy here) on national television". Now there is someone who is willing to put more than their money where their mouth is.</div>

We gather requirements for a system and then we proceed to design and build it with teams based at our offices in Melrose Arch, Centurion and Cape Town. As we&rsquo;re advocates of Agile SDLCs we try to communicate progress frequently and prefer a high level of interaction with product owners or client stakeholders to get prompt feedback on development. We&rsquo;re good at this model and we&rsquo;ve provided many high-quality systems to our clients in this way.\n  \n More recently though we&rsquo;ve been engaging with clients and colleagues in different ways. For instance, when a colleague decided to move to Eastern Europe last year he continued to work for us, producing mobile dev, for the first six months of his new life there. We now have several engagements where we have expanded our onsite team augmentation model to include remote teams.\n  \n It&rsquo;s this remote augmentation model that I am particularly interested in.\n First, let me paint the perfect remote augmentation picture from my point of view. Teams that really nail this will be able to onboard and work with colleagues who are not coming into the same office as them. Being able to learn the domain, access systems and communicate with the wider team, will not be impacted by lack of physical presence. Remote members of a team will contribute and be valued in exactly the same way as their colleagues and they will undertake all the same tasks as the core team.\n The idea of such a team is attractive to me as a Delivery Manager because it opens up possibilities to support our clients in new ways. By tapping into the major commercial hubs in South Africa we can find the best composition of skillsets and experience to help them achieve their development aims. No doubt, it has to be better for our economy and the growth of South Africa&rsquo;s IT industry to recruit people in this country rather than looking abroad, and as the IT skills pool is relatively isolated in this country we need to be flexible in our approaches to teams.\n  \n What have I learned so far?\n To assume that remote augmentation will work in just the same way local augmentation does (we all just use jira and get on with it, right?) is simplistic in the extreme. By its nature, augmenting into a team typically requires much closer interaction, both in terms of frequency of communication and in the nature of tasks being taken on. It should be perfectly normal for the person sitting 400km away to develop the service tier which the front end developer sitting locally will consume, or visa versa. However, achieving this is not always trivial.\n  \n (The right) tech can help\n Tech has been the enabler of people working remotely so its unsurprising that it sits at the center of any solution to remote working. Its vital to have the correct array of communication mediums available and that the team members are able to use them appropriately. The humble telephone still has a huge part to play but provisioning a team with IM, video conferencing, group messaging such as Slack, as well as the now common tools like Jira and BitBucket is key removing the inherent friction in communicating from a remote location. Products such as Basecamp are also available, they aim to provide a single platform off which you can run a distributed team. It goes without saying that high speed, stable network access for the remote teams is a &lsquo;must&rsquo; as well. Security policies, especially of corporates, need to align to allow remote workers access to all the systems they need to do their job.\n  \n The remote team is not a second class citizen\n The ideal here is that remote colleagues simply pull tasks off the same backlog as the core team. I have seen instances though where the core team allocate simpler tasks to the remote team under the reasoning that they&rsquo;ll be easier to do in isolation (this is also a common model when dealing with high capacity offshore teams in places like India and the Philippines).

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;By Shashi Hansjee (Entelect, CEO)\n  \n We have a few questions that we ask people joining our company, to get to know them better. One of which is their favourite book. Granted, we are a technology company and so naturally will have a larger than average number of readers, but pretty much every person speaks passionately about one or two particular books that really spoke to them. Of course, most of these are fiction, but when people say that nobody reads anymore, it&rsquo;s not true.\n One of my favourite quotes is from Warren Buffet. When asked about the key to success, he said &ldquo;Read 500 pages every day. That&rsquo;s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.&rdquo; He also followed up that statement with &ldquo;All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.&rdquo;\n  \n From a business reading perspective, I never manage to get through as many books as I&rsquo;d like to, but I do manage to read at least one or two per month. I&rsquo;ve found there are a few tricks to developing a concentrated reading list, compared to the four or five per month many other thought-leading executives seem get through.\n  \n Firstly, experiment. Amazon have an enormous range of books and their recommendations generally work well. Reading reviews, checking out the contents and reading the first chapter before you buy will help you identify those books that are outside the obvious bestsellers and can offer amazing insights.\n  \n Secondly, be aware and be creative. If you take just one idea from a book and apply it to your business, then the time spent is worth it. At times, it might not be obviously applicable, but being aware, and thinking outside the box when reading, has led to some of the most successful initiatives in our business today.\n  \n Finally, variety is important. Generally, people get hung up on reading one type of book &ndash; either strategy, or other peoples&rsquo; success stories, or topics that are only applicable to their area or role. Variety is key to expanding the mind and promoting creativity. Some of the more technical or specialised subject matter-focussed books are a heavier read, but often that extra detail and depth can yield the most practical ideas.\n  \n So, invest in your knowledge by reading regularly. Challenge your existing knowledge by picking up books that sit outside of your comfort zone and think laterally while reading. There is no rule as to where a creative solution to a business problem can come from. What is certain, is that you don&rsquo;t have to be at executive level to bring a great idea into a business or your team and change the way things are done for the better.&quot;}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;By Matthew Butler (Entelect, General Manager : Managed Solutions)\n  \n You could coast through a career of 40 years, or become formidable in 5. This is a look at two mechanisms to stay on the accelerator, grow as a professional and make an impact wherever you are. These mechanisms are your attitude towards learning, and your willingness to understand context. These are two stand-out concepts I've learnt and observed in my own journey from junior to leadership. It is scary how this conventional wisdom is lost or diluted in many companies.\n\nEssentially these do boil down to critical thinking, but let&rsquo;s take a moment to explore learning and context as two of the easier ways to change your mindset towards your work, get ahead of your peers, and stand out! We individually have control of these areas of our professional lives. In particular, attitudes or mindsets like these have nothing to do with industry knowledge, experience or technical skill. Your stance is your key to a massively accelerated career, if you want it.\n\nWe land in our roles full of uncertainty but ambitious because of it. We are motivated to learn and are terrified of underperformance. The mystery of a new career energises us greatly through new purpose and problems. We must justify our selection to join a team and hold a position. Does this sound familiar?\n\nSometime into your role you learn the recipe. You solve many of the mysteries, and deeply understand how a team or organisation operates. Through this clarification the novelty of the role wears off, and human nature dictates that we start to lose interest. We stop pushing ourselves as our expectations align with our customer&rsquo;s or employer&rsquo;s expectations. We stop growing and start doing. As these external factors - new people, new expectations and environments wear off, it&rsquo;s time for internal factors to kick in..\n\nSo here they are, two dynamos which you can apply to change your perspective; to stop doing and start growing:\n\nOne: learn on your own time.\n\nThis is self-investment. You&rsquo;re not waiting for your employer to force you on training or sponsor you, you&rsquo;re doing it on your own time and your own dime. You&rsquo;re realising that you are the captain of your career and have an obligation to do this for yourself. It also accelerates you within your organisation because you can offer more (incidentally why you were attractive to an organisation in the first place). If you are clearly investing in yourself it sends a critical message to your team and management that you care about your productivity in a vacuum. If you aren&rsquo;t relying on your employer to carry you, it sets a very different balance of power.\n\nPeople who invest in themselves regardless of circumstance, employer or project are independent. They&rsquo;re keeping themselves ahead of the curve, which is a hugely magnetic concept. You probably want to work with other people like this, because they have so much to offer. It&rsquo;s not just wisdom or skill either. Independence breeds positivity and focus, characteristics which help projects succeed and businesses grow. If you commit openly with yourself, your team and your company to spend your own time learning and developing yourself, you become a giver and not a taker, a transformation.\n\nTwo: obsess over context.\n\nThis one is a little more complex but still nothing ground-breaking. The idea here is to always remember why you&rsquo;re doing something. Some call this big picture thinking but I believe it is more nuanced. Context is about self-awareness; it&rsquo;s about business sense, selflessness and objective thinking. Introspect for a second, ask yourself if everything you&rsquo;re doing and saying right now within your current project is in the best interests of the success of that project? Does your attitude show a care for, and understanding of circumstances? Business environment, customers, budget demands, time pressures. Does your team and leadership absolutely trust you to think for yourself; have you demonstrated that you can?\n\nThis is harder to balance because what we need to do or say in the best interests of the project may not align so perfectly with our personal measurement of things. This is also a common perspective (or measurement) of maturity - our ability to put personal agenda aside in these circumstances and to prioritise the team or business&rsquo;s needs. Once context is mixed into the picture, motivation will come more naturally as we demonstrate a balanced intent and clarity of purpose.\n\nAnother introspection for you to try: when the dust settles, what will your contribution be? Douglas Kruger talks about this in his book &ldquo;Own your Industry&rdquo; (a cool read by the way). He talks about speaking the language of results when we are trying to sell something. He encourages us to think about outcomes as what people and businesses are attracted to, as opposed to the input, features or tasks. If you &ldquo;do a thing&rdquo; you&rsquo;re a commodity, if you &ldquo;get a result&rdquo; you&rsquo;re a in a position of power.\n\nThese two mindsets are made even more interesting because they present a curious balance of their own. Self-investment can be considered selfish and unrelated to your role, but context is 100% selfless and focused on the narrow agenda. The important realisation is that our stance when it comes to these two elements of ourselves are powerful levers to pull. They influence how we are perceived in our roles and should be understood to be taken advantage of.\n\nCoast along a career through the slow march of time, or force some perspective. Motivate yourself to continuously learn for your own sake, and remember to deliberately empathise with business objectives. Make a bigger impact, get noticed, grow.&quot;}">

We are motivated to learn and are terrified of underperformance. The mystery of a new career energises us greatly through new purpose and problems. We must justify our selection to join a team and hold a position. Does this sound familiar?<br /><br />Sometime into your role you learn the recipe. You solve many of the mysteries, and deeply understand how a team or organisation operates. Through this clarification the novelty of the role wears off, and human nature dictates that we start to lose interest. We stop pushing ourselves as our expectations align with our customer&rsquo;s or employer&rsquo;s expectations. We stop growing and start doing. As these external factors - new people, new expectations and environments wear off, it&rsquo;s time for internal factors to kick in..<br /><br />So here they are, two dynamos which you can apply to change your perspective; to stop doing and start growing:<br /><br />One: learn on your own time.<br /><br />This is self-investment. You&rsquo;re not waiting for your employer to force you on training or sponsor you, you&rsquo;re doing it on your own time and your own dime. You&rsquo;re realising that you are the captain of your career and have an obligation to do this for yourself. It also accelerates you within your organisation because you can offer more (incidentally why you were attractive to an organisation in the first place). If you are clearly investing in yourself it sends a critical message to your team and management that you care about your productivity in a vacuum. If you aren&rsquo;t relying on your employer to carry you, it sets a very different balance of power.<br /><br />People who invest in themselves regardless of circumstance, employer or project are independent. They&rsquo;re keeping themselves ahead of the curve, which is a hugely magnetic concept. You probably want to work with other people like this, because they have so much to offer. It&rsquo;s not just wisdom or skill either. Independence breeds positivity and focus, characteristics which help projects succeed and businesses grow. If you commit openly with yourself, your team and your company to spend your own time learning and developing yourself, you become a giver and not a taker, a transformation.<br /><br />Two: obsess over context.<br /><br />This one is a little more complex but still nothing ground-breaking. The idea here is to always remember why you&rsquo;re doing something. Some call this big picture thinking but I believe it is more nuanced. Context is about self-awareness; it&rsquo;s about business sense, selflessness and objective thinking. Introspect for a second, ask yourself if everything you&rsquo;re doing and saying right now within your current project is in the best interests of the success of that project? Does your attitude show a care for, and understanding of circumstances? Business environment, customers, budget demands, time pressures. Does your team and leadership absolutely trust you to think for yourself; have you demonstrated that you can?<br /><br />This is harder to balance because what we need to do or say in the best interests of the project may not align so perfectly with our personal measurement of things. This is also a common perspective (or measurement) of maturity - our ability to put personal agenda aside in these circumstances and to prioritise the team or business&rsquo;s needs. Once context is mixed into the picture, motivation will come more naturally as we demonstrate a balanced intent and clarity of purpose.<br /><br />Another introspection for you to try: when the dust settles, what will your contribution be? Douglas Kruger talks about this in his book &ldquo;Own your Industry&rdquo; (a cool read by the way). He talks about speaking the language of results when we are trying to sell something. He encourages us to think about outcomes as what people and businesses are attracted to, as opposed to the input, features or tasks. If you &ldquo;do a thing&rdquo; you&rsquo;re a commodity, if you &ldquo;get a result&rdquo; you&rsquo;re a in a position of power.<br /><br />These two mindsets are made even more interesting because they present a curious balance of their own. Self-investment can be considered selfish and unrelated to your role, but context is 100% selfless and focused on the narrow agenda. The important realisation is that our stance when it comes to these two elements of ourselves are powerful levers to pull. They influence how we are perceived in our roles and should be understood to be taken advantage of.<br /><br />Coast along a career through the slow march of time, or force some perspective. Motivate yourself to continuously learn for your own sake, and remember to deliberately empathise with business objectives. Make a bigger impact, get noticed, grow.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Performance reviews which make a real difference&quot;}">Performance reviews which make a real difference</td>
<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Daniel walks confidently down the corridor towards the meeting room booked out for the latest round of bi-annual performance reviews. He is dressed for success, notes in hand and undoubtedly prepared to showcase his achievements over the last six months. In contrast, Joshua looks uninterested, unprepared and ready to leave before he arrives. In both these vastly different review scenarios, there is a lot of preparation needed by a manager and employee in order to get the most out of performance reviews.\n Let&rsquo;s take a step back. It&rsquo;s 2019 &ndash; why are we even bothering with bi-annual performance reviews? Many argue that bi-annual performance reviews are outdated, and we should rather focus on the holy grail of performance reviews: the ongoing informal feedback loop. I agree wholeheartedly. The hard reality is that people just don&rsquo;t know how to give valuable, honest and constructive feedback, continuously, or just don&rsquo;t have the time to do it.\n Bi-annual performance reviews take dedicated time to prepare, discuss, review and plan; recognising an individual&rsquo;s successes and providing the all-important career direction. Bi-annual performance reviews form part of the continuous feedback loop.\n For Daniel, his motivator is success and status, and the performance review is all about measuring his progress towards his goals and highlighting achievements. His review period has been stellar, filled with successful project deployments, value-adding features that he initiated, and customer reviews beaming with commendations. Joshua has had an even better review period, but what motivates him isn&rsquo;t success &ndash; it&rsquo;s mastery and the depth of the technical challenges he has faced and come out on top of.\n In these scenarios, both Daniel and Joshua have done amazing work. If we as managers just highlight the achievements and don&rsquo;t offer a way forward or don&rsquo;t understand their motivators/career aspirations, we are doing a disservice to the excellent individual that stands before us. For someone that hasn&rsquo;t had a good review period, if we focus only on the faults without explaining the implications and providing actionable feedback, guidance or opportunities, we are not doing our jobs of cultivating talent.\n It&rsquo;s important to focus on the positives and the negatives, regardless of the performance of the individual. That is how you guide people to grow.\n Before we can discuss how to prepare for a review, we need to understand what the outcomes of a review should be:\n Part of our responsibility as managers is to cultivate talent, grow the people we work with and provide a clear, actionable path for people to go down on in their careers. We&rsquo;re focused on the perspective of the reviewer and not the reviewee in this article, but it is important to note that it is the responsibility of both the reviewer and the reviewee to make sure that a review is beneficial. \n The following list of outcomes should be a focus of any performance review:\n  Get a sense of individual achievements. People want to be recognised for the great work they do. Give them the recognition they deserve.\n Understand the challenges the person may have or has overcome. If someone is still experiencing the challenges, identifying what they are is a great way to become an enabler for them. Knowing the challenges they have overcome helps to remind them of the growth they experienced over the review period.\n Identify the strong skills the individual has and help to leverage those. By highlighting the strengths people have and explaining how important those are in one&rsquo;s career, reinforces great behaviour and shows an understanding of what the individual has to offer.\n Identify the skills that need refinement. Nobody is great at everything, so there will always be skills that need refinement or growth as one moves down their career path.\n Setting and tracking goals set out by the person. Setting goals is multifaceted. You could use a goal as an opportunity to grow a skill identified earlier, or help the individual do something that they are passionate about that is outside of their work. Goal setting helps put together something actionable to achieve but helps for accountability too.\n Gauge sentiment. This one is simple, find out if the person is happy in the role they are in, the work they are doing or the interactions they have with their team. Action something if the person isn&rsquo;t happy.\n Deepen a relationship with the individual. This going without saying, building strong relationships with your team is a must. It helps to be honest, to understand the people on the team, what inspires them, how to communicate with them, where they come from, and what is important to them. It shows that you care. It also improves your credibility as a manager.\n  How to deliver the feedback, career guidance and support in the review:\n When one leaves a review, they should feel as though they have been able to speak their mind, talk about what is important to them, have a clear understanding of the next steps and feel excited about the challenges ahead. Effective performance feedback looks both backward and forward, speaks to behaviours and skills as attributes, not the person, and explains the impact and consequences of those attributes.\n The following guidelines should be exercised when providing feedback:\n  Listen first and ask questions to clarify understanding. Most people crave the opportunity to talk and share their views; to feel as though they are listened to. It is a discussion, not a lecture. Be clear in your understanding of what the reviewee is saying and don&rsquo;t make assumptions.\n Be constructive by reviewing a skill and not the person. Feedback should be seen as an opportunity to learn more about yourself professionally, not be personal.\n Give specific and concrete examples where performance was good or poor. Saying things like &ldquo;you are a very good communicator&rdquo; vs &ldquo;you are great at explaining very technical terms to non-technical people and ensuring that everyone in the room understands the way forward while making people feel part of the team&rdquo; is very different.\n Explain the impact of good and poor behaviour. You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know. Talk about the reasons why something impacts the team or the project so that the reviewee gains experience and develops insight.\n Provide opportunities or ways to stretch and improve skills. If you don&rsquo;t give an opportunity or a clear way to achieve a goal, most people get stuck and say that the opportunities don&rsquo;t exist in the current work environment. There is always an opportunity, one simply needs to explain what it is and the measurables from it.\n Provide the appropriate support. Support comes in many formats. Providing training, having face time to soundboard ideas, removing blockers or introducing the right people at the right time. Be available and offer support to achieve goals.\n Exercise EQ. This one is tricky, but the gist of it is that in a review, your feedback and tone need to be adjusted to each person you are reviewing. Feedback often comes with emotions, but when the intent is to be constructive, honest and to grow the person, delivery of the feedback becomes much easier.\n Exercise accountability. Often review feedback requires tough conversations. Accountability is only effectively achieved when there is an agreement in place, a clear understanding of the boundaries and knowing how to measure success. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to hold people accountable.\n  Let&rsquo;s explore how this strategy played out with Daniel and Joshua.\n Daniel is a rock star engineer, and a natural leader in the team, even though he is relatively early in his career. His review started out as a highlights reel where we discussed all his achievements and the impact that he has made to the project and client (listen first, recognise achievements). We spoke about his strong technical skills, such as estimations in his own work and his ability to problem-solve (identify strong skills), but also identified that he doesn&rsquo;t know how to estimate other people&rsquo;s throughput (identify skills to refine). This resulted in him setting deadlines he couldn&rsquo;t meet and then pouring his heart and soul into the project to make sure it got delivered on time (explain the impact).\n Although admirable in his desire to get things done and see things through, it meant that Daniel wasn&rsquo;t dedicating time to his other passion, rock climbing, and he would ultimately suffer burnout (understanding his challenges). We put together a dedicated meeting slot to review every estimation made on his own work and that of the others on the team to see how he would improve over time and adjust accordingly (provide the appropriate support). We also agreed that he should do the things he is passionate about and that I would call him out if he didn&rsquo;t do at least one trip to the nearest indoor rock climbing gym once a month (agreeing to a goal and shared accountability).\n Joshua, our technically-minded defender of quality and champion of best practices entered the room and didn&rsquo;t say much. Highlighting all the achievements and technical brilliance he brought to the team from my point of view is how the review started (recognise achievements). We proceeded to talk about the solutions he was delivering on the project and if he still felt as though the work was challenging (gauging sentiment). He was very happy and felt as though he was still adding huge value. The next thing we spoke about was his career path. He wants to go down the path of being a Solutions Architect; so we chatted about the need to grow the skills of influencing change and being able to address non-technical people (identifying skills to grow). These skills would be grown by running project planning workshops, and joining the analysis meetings with the business analysts (provide the right opportunities to improve skills). His strengths in holding people accountable would provide the legitimacy in a room of non-technical people as being the trusted advisor on the team (leveraging strong skills).\n Preparation and clear feedback are key. Think of the outcomes you want to achieve from a performance review before it starts. Providing great tactile feedback gives clear direction and makes a review meaningful. To take it a step further, share your intent, and get the reviewee to prepare for the review following the same guidelines.\n At Entelect, we are all about staying true to our core values through our performance reviews. Through being open &amp; honest and building meaningful relationships during reviews means that relationships set us apart. By providing clear actionable feedback, we ensure that for those within our organisation, growth isn&rsquo;t optional.&quot;}">

He is dressed for success, notes in hand and undoubtedly prepared to showcase his achievements over the last six months. In contrast, Joshua looks uninterested, unprepared and ready to leave before he arrives. In both these vastly different review scenarios, there is a lot of preparation needed by a manager and employee in order to get the most out of performance reviews.<br />Let&rsquo;s take a step back. It&rsquo;s 2019 &ndash; why are we even bothering with bi-annual performance reviews? Many argue that bi-annual performance reviews are outdated, and we should rather focus on the holy grail of performance reviews: the ongoing informal feedback loop. I agree wholeheartedly. The hard reality is that people just don&rsquo;t know how to give valuable, honest and constructive feedback, continuously, or just don&rsquo;t have the time to do it.<br />Bi-annual performance reviews take dedicated time to prepare, discuss, review and plan; recognising an individual&rsquo;s successes and providing the all-important career direction. Bi-annual performance reviews form part of the continuous feedback loop.<br />For Daniel, his motivator is success and status, and the performance review is all about measuring his progress towards his goals and highlighting achievements. His review period has been stellar, filled with successful project deployments, value-adding features that he initiated, and customer reviews beaming with commendations. Joshua has had an even better review period, but what motivates him isn&rsquo;t success &ndash; it&rsquo;s mastery and the depth of the technical challenges he has faced and come out on top of.<br />In these scenarios, both Daniel and Joshua have done amazing work. If we as managers just highlight the achievements and don&rsquo;t offer a way forward or don&rsquo;t understand their motivators/career aspirations, we are doing a disservice to the excellent individual that stands before us. For someone that hasn&rsquo;t had a good review period, if we focus only on the faults without explaining the implications and providing actionable feedback, guidance or opportunities, we are not doing our jobs of cultivating talent.<br />It&rsquo;s important to focus on the positives and the negatives, regardless of the performance of the individual. That is how you guide people to grow.<br />Before we can discuss how to prepare for a review, we need to understand what the outcomes of a review should be:<br />Part of our responsibility as managers is to cultivate talent, grow the people we work with and provide a clear, actionable path for people to go down on in their careers. We&rsquo;re focused on the perspective of the reviewer and not the reviewee in this article, but it is important to note that it is the responsibility of both the reviewer and the reviewee to make sure that a review is beneficial. <br />The following list of outcomes should be a focus of any performance review:<br />Get a sense of individual achievements. People want to be recognised for the great work they do. Give them the recognition they deserve.<br />Understand the challenges the person may have or has overcome. If someone is still experiencing the challenges, identifying what they are is a great way to become an enabler for them. Knowing the challenges they have overcome helps to remind them of the growth they experienced over the review period.<br />Identify the strong skills the individual has and help to leverage those. By highlighting the strengths people have and explaining how important those are in one&rsquo;s career, reinforces great behaviour and shows an understanding of what the individual has to offer.<br />Identify the skills that need refinement. Nobody is great at everything, so there will always be skills that need refinement or growth as one moves down their career path.<br />Setting and tracking goals set out by the person. Setting goals is multifaceted. You could use a goal as an opportunity to grow a skill identified earlier, or help the individual do something that they are passionate about that is outside of their work. Goal setting helps put together something actionable to achieve but helps for accountability too.<br />Gauge sentiment. This one is simple, find out if the person is happy in the role they are in, the work they are doing or the interactions they have with their team. Action something if the person isn&rsquo;t happy.<br />Deepen a relationship with the individual. This going without saying, building strong relationships with your team is a must. It helps to be honest, to understand the people on the team, what inspires them, how to communicate with them, where they come from, and what is important to them. It shows that you care. It also improves your credibility as a manager.<br />How to deliver the feedback, career guidance and support in the review:<br />When one leaves a review, they should feel as though they have been able to speak their mind, talk about what is important to them, have a clear understanding of the next steps and feel excited about the challenges ahead. Effective performance feedback looks both backward and forward, speaks to behaviours and skills as attributes, not the person, and explains the impact and consequences of those attributes.<br />The following guidelines should be exercised when providing feedback:<br />Listen first and ask questions to clarify understanding. Most people crave the opportunity to talk and share their views; to feel as though they are listened to. It is a discussion, not a lecture. Be clear in your understanding of what the reviewee is saying and don&rsquo;t make assumptions.<br />Be constructive by reviewing a skill and not the person. Feedback should be seen as an opportunity to learn more about yourself professionally, not be personal.<br />Give specific and concrete examples where performance was good or poor. Saying things like &ldquo;you are a very good communicator&rdquo; vs &ldquo;you are great at explaining very technical terms to non-technical people and ensuring that everyone in the room understands the way forward while making people feel part of the team&rdquo; is very different.<br />Explain the impact of good and poor behaviour. You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know. Talk about the reasons why something impacts the team or the project so that the reviewee gains experience and develops insight.<br />Provide opportunities or ways to stretch and improve skills. If you don&rsquo;t give an opportunity or a clear way to achieve a goal, most people get stuck and say that the opportunities don&rsquo;t exist in the current work environment. There is always an opportunity, one simply needs to explain what it is and the measurables from it.<br />Provide the appropriate support. Support comes in many formats. Providing training, having face time to soundboard ideas, removing blockers or introducing the right people at the right time. Be available and offer support to achieve goals.<br />Exercise EQ. This one is tricky, but the gist of it is that in a review, your feedback and tone need to be adjusted to each person you are reviewing. Feedback often comes with emotions, but when the intent is to be constructive, honest and to grow the person, delivery of the feedback becomes much easier.<br />Exercise accountability. Often review feedback requires tough conversations. Accountability is only effectively achieved when there is an agreement in place, a clear understanding of the boundaries and knowing how to measure success. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to hold people accountable.<br />Let&rsquo;s explore how this strategy played out with Daniel and Joshua.<br />Daniel is a rock star engineer, and a natural leader in the team, even though he is relatively early in his career. His review started out as a highlights reel where we discussed all his achievements and the impact that he has made to the project and client (listen first, recognise achievements). We spoke about his strong technical skills, such as estimations in his own work and his ability to problem-solve (identify strong skills), but also identified that he doesn&rsquo;t know how to estimate other people&rsquo;s throughput (identify skills to refine). This resulted in him setting deadlines he couldn&rsquo;t meet and then pouring his heart and soul into the project to make sure it got delivered on time (explain the impact).<br />Although admirable in his desire to get things done and see things through, it meant that Daniel wasn&rsquo;t dedicating time to his other passion, rock climbing, and he would ultimately suffer burnout (understanding his challenges). We put together a dedicated meeting slot to review every estimation made on his own work and that of the others on the team to see how he would improve over time and adjust accordingly (provide the appropriate support). We also agreed that he should do the things he is passionate about and that I would call him out if he didn&rsquo;t do at least one trip to the nearest indoor rock climbing gym once a month (agreeing to a goal and shared accountability).<br />Joshua, our technically-minded defender of quality and champion of best practices entered the room and didn&rsquo;t say much. Highlighting all the achievements and technical brilliance he brought to the team from my point of view is how the review started (recognise achievements). We proceeded to talk about the solutions he was delivering on the project and if he still felt as though the work was challenging (gauging sentiment). He was very happy and felt as though he was still adding huge value. The next thing we spoke about was his career path. He wants to go down the path of being a Solutions Architect; so we chatted about the need to grow the skills of influencing change and being able to address non-technical people (identifying skills to grow). These skills would be grown by running project planning workshops, and joining the analysis meetings with the business analysts (provide the right opportunities to improve skills). His strengths in holding people accountable would provide the legitimacy in a room of non-technical people as being the trusted advisor on the team (leveraging strong skills).<br />Preparation and clear feedback are key. Think of the outcomes you want to achieve from a performance review before it starts. Providing great tactile feedback gives clear direction and makes a review meaningful. To take it a step further, share your intent, and get the reviewee to prepare for the review following the same guidelines.<br />At Entelect, we are all about staying true to our core values through our performance reviews. Through being open &amp; honest and building meaningful relationships during reviews means that relationships set us apart. By providing clear actionable feedback, we ensure that for those within our organisation, growth isn&rsquo;t optional.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Many companies in the STEM environment, both across Africa and globally, have come to the realisation that striving towards a gender-balanced workforce is an inevitable goal for the future. And although this is what we are aiming towards, there is no simple solution or silver bullet to achieve this.\n \nAdditionally, ensuring diversity along age, religion, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, languages and educational lines is also crucial for a holistic workforce representative of the global economy.\n \nBut why is this important and what impact does it have?\n \n1. Diversity of thought leads to greater problem solving\n  \n In any problem-solving situation, having a diverse set of experiences to draw from is always beneficial. Although it&rsquo;s not always immediately obvious in a STEM setting, diversity of life experience is just as important as the technical and vocational experience within a team.\n This needs to be paired with a strong framework and a focused leadership to get the maximum value out of this diversity of thought.\n  \n The Harvard Business Review explores this in more detail here.\n  \n 2.

This ultimately led to higher profits.\n  \n 3. Greater economic and employment benefits for the wider market\n  \n The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has analysed multiple data sources across the European Union and its member states to extrapolate two key positive economic outcomes for STEM within the EU. Although the European Union is a vastly different market to Africa, we believe the tangential benefits for Africa would be very similar.\n  \n a. Increasing the participation of women in STEM subjects will have a strong positive GDP impact at EU level. Closing the gender gap in STEM would contribute to an increase in EU GDP per capita by 2.2 to 3.0% in 2050. In monetary terms, closing the STEM gap leads to an improvement in GDP by &euro;610 - &euro;820 billion in 2050.\n  \n b. Closing gender gaps in STEM education would have a positive impact on employment. Total EU employment would rise by 850 000 to 1 200 000 by 2050. These jobs are forecasted mostly in the long term as employment rates will rise only after more women studying STEM finish their education.\n \nThere are many factors impacting education, skills and career development. We need to understand these factors so that inclusivity opportunities can be addressed. If these are not addressed, it will drive further inequality among these workforces.\n \nAn equal workforce in STEM is vital for many reasons, however it is not a simple problem to solve. If we are committed to evolving our workforce to be more gender-equal, and ensure diversity of thought, we need to take the correct steps towards achieving this.\n \nGovernment, business, and society need to work together in order to make this viable. Starting in homes, parents will need to understand what STEM careers are available to their children and encourage them to get into these fields after school. Companies need to get more involved with educating the community by reskilling and upskilling, and government needs to speed up the roll-out of STEM &ndash; in particular technology in schools throughout South Africa.\n \nThe future workforce can be an equal one but the work must start now to drive these changes, in order for this to become a reality sooner rather than later.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:1128,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1132}{&quot;1&quot;:1197,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/is-there-a-payoff-from-top-team-diversity&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1215}{&quot;1&quot;:1708,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/methods-tools/about&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:1739}">

Closing gender gaps in STEM education would have a positive impact on employment. Total EU employment would rise by 850 000 to 1 200 000 by 2050. These jobs are forecasted mostly in the long term as employment rates will rise only after more women studying STEM finish their education.<br /><br />There are many factors impacting education, skills and career development. We need to understand these factors so that inclusivity opportunities can be addressed. If these are not addressed, it will drive further inequality among these workforces.<br /><br />An equal workforce in STEM is vital for many reasons, however it is not a simple problem to solve. If we are committed to evolving our workforce to be more gender-equal, and ensure diversity of thought, we need to take the correct steps towards achieving this.<br /><br />Government, business, and society need to work together in order to make this viable. Starting in homes, parents will need to understand what STEM careers are available to their children and encourage them to get into these fields after school. Companies need to get more involved with educating the community by reskilling and upskilling, and government needs to speed up the roll-out of STEM &ndash; in particular technology in schools throughout South Africa.<br /><br />The future workforce can be an equal one but the work must start now to drive these changes, in order for this to become a reality sooner rather than later.</div>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Few can argue that 2020 hasn&rsquo;t been full of worldwide rollercoasters &ndash; the biggest being the global COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the accelerated spread of the virus, many organisations have been forced to adapt to a remote working model.\n Technology companies have been working with distributed teams for years. For most organisations, this hasn&rsquo;t been by choice, but rather due to the shortage of skills in the industry. In such a globalised world, building the right technology team with the right skills, experience and chemistry is very unlikely to happen in one location.\n At Entelect, we have been running distributed and remote teams for some time now, and so are fortunate enough to not be too disrupted by these unforeseen changes. Below are 5 lessons we&rsquo;d like to share with others in industry who are perhaps finding themselves in unfamiliar territory:\n Lesson 1: Your technological workforce will adapt easily. Be sure to pay attention to non-technical team members who might need support.\nDevelopers, technologists and tinkerers are usually content with working in solitude. They are used to installing and configuring tools, and having their workload managed via a virtual SCRUM board on Jira or Azure DevOps. This means their workflow is the least impacted in a remote delivery environment. On the other hand, analysts, scrum masters, product owners, subject-matter specialists and other less technical roles have a disproportionately harder challenge being as effective as they would have been in a fully co-located working model.\n During disruptive times like these, it&rsquo;s important to establish what degree of frequent communication is required. A well-balanced distributed team should have low-comms roles making an effort to support the high-comms roles, and recognise that this might be a more difficult adjustment for them.\n Lesson 2: Ensure there&rsquo;s someone to bridge the gap.\nWhen running a distributed team, there is often a gap between the remote team and the on-site business team. This gap can cause anything from delays in feedback from business to overall patchy communication between the teams. Having somebody &ldquo;on the inside&rdquo; is critical for all distributed teams.\n Although it&rsquo;s not always logistically possible, there should ideally be at least one allocated person from the distributed team who is physically based at the business. This person needs to be specifically tasked with helping the remote team by working closely with the business, and acting as a translator and clarification layer between your distributed engineering team and the business. When urgent feedback is required or if there are blockers preventing progress during the project, having an ally to receive mandates or requirements is immeasurably valuable.\n Lesson 3: Culture is critical.\nIf you&rsquo;re completely new to running a remote team, focusing on culture is probably more important now than ever. Switching to distributed model is not an easy transition &ndash; especially if it&rsquo;s done abruptly. Digital tools will go a long way during these transitions, but focusing on team culture will take it a lot further.\n Don&rsquo;t disregard the importance of how people interact to solve problems, socialise and support each other. This might be a good time to relook at your team charter and ensure that the unique attributes that kept your team&rsquo;s culture alive are still implemented, even when working remotely. Over time, this will result in a culture of delivery regardless of which working model you&rsquo;re using.\n Lesson 4: Collaboration is easy, communication is hard.\nTeams often have a big push towards collaboration when working remotely. There is no need to start stressing about collaboration. It&rsquo;s only as difficult as it always was, and only as good as your communication. This is why you need to focus on communication instead. Communication in distributed or remote teams is extremely challenging, and therefore collaboration becomes more difficult.\n Good collaboration flows from good communication, and if you spend time and effort on improving comms in your team, you&rsquo;ll naturally get better at collaborating. The biggest communication challenges in running distributed teams are availability and responsiveness. You need to establish when each team member is available during the day and agree on how frequently everyone responds to requests or enquiries. Lack of availability and responsiveness in teams create bottlenecks that will delay the success of the project.\n The challenge here is not the administrative tasks of potentially moving your project backlog to a virtual application or using digital tools to collaborate. It is rather fostering a communication environment that allows for availability and responsiveness to thrive.\n Lesson 5: Mistakes will be made.\nChange is difficult and can often be frustrating. Very rarely will teams pick up a new working model without some hurdles along the way &ndash; and that&rsquo;s okay. Learning to use new communication tools and facing other difficulties like portraying tone and body language correctly will be an adaptation for any team. Have patience with each other and go through these changes as a team.\n For many organisations who are currently not using a remote working model by choice but rather due to circumstances, this is the ideal opportunity to see the potential this model has to offer. When you&rsquo;re capable and confident in how you operate projects with a distributed workforce, scaling teams becomes substantially easier because you can source and manage them anywhere. There is also value in running the right distributed team versus the wrong co-located team. Don&rsquo;t view a remote working model as a present complication, but rather as an opportunity to prove your team&rsquo;s determination when faced with challenges, and prepare your business for new ways of working.&quot;}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=59112" data-sheets-hyperlinkruns="{&quot;1&quot;:601,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=59112&quot;}{&quot;1&quot;:637}">

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Innovation as a business concept has many definitions. At its core, the central theme of innovation is the successful delivery of an idea that brings positive value to a company and its customers. However, where there is a large diversity of thought when it comes to the subject, is how to successfully build a &ldquo;culture of innovation&rdquo;.\n Is it implementing new processes? Is it investing in collaboration technologies and services? Is it ensuring employees have the freedom to fail? Is it setting up innovation labs? Or is it the CEO purely stating the company will now &ldquo;innovate&rdquo;?\n There is no silver bullet and most of the above can be parts of a greater strategy to foster a culture of innovation. (Side note &ndash; leadership is critical but it is an ongoing commitment, not a singular sermon from above.) But like so many things in business, innovation starts with the makeup of the people within a business.\n Innovation starts with people coming up with great ideas. The nature, quality and quantity of these ideas can be impacted by multiple factors &ndash; the underlying company culture, access to technology and resources, the ever-important factor of time to ideate amongst many others &ndash; but always comes back to the source, which is people.\n With the starting point being people, what is the best strategy of ensuring that the initial idea factory of business is in the best position to drive a culture and output of innovation? The quantity and quality of ideas are most positively impacted by a diversity of thought and this is achieved through the diversity of your people.\n Focusing on evolving the diversity of the people within your business across all the usual factors of demographics, education and experience will organically diversify and strengthen the ideation process. This allows your people to bring their exposure from different cultures that they have experienced throughout their personal and professional lives.\n However, that is just one part of it. It is arguably even more important to ensure within any ideation process, session or project to bring in people from multiple disciplines even if their roles and/or expertise don&rsquo;t naturally fit. A technology-focused ideation project for an app-based development team may not seem like the place for the brand marketing intern to come up with an amazing idea or feature. Through their experience as a frequent app user who spent six months travelling through Europe before starting their role, for example, will give them a far different perspective. This will allow them to provide an insight that a room of app developers would probably never come up with, but those developers than then use their expertise to take the idea and make it the next major feature release.\n You can interchange &ldquo;brand marketing intern&rdquo; with anyone within a business as ideas don&rsquo;t come from a qualification but a lifetime of experiences unique to each person. The more diverse those experiences and exposure to varied cultures only widens the scope of thinking within a team.\n So when thinking of how to create a culture of innovation that thrives, start with your people, create an environment to foster thinking, give them the time and the tools to create, look at the cultures they have experienced and always expand the diversity of these cultures to foster a successful one unique to your business.&quot;}">
