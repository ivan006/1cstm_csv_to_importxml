We had a difficult 2010 as a result of a couple of sizable project delays beyond our control, but closed off the year well with the start of a few big projects, in particular Liberty BurnjOules &ndash; an online loyalty programme for Liberty Health. This is a full software outsource to Entelect and with version 1 launch now complete, we understand it is the single biggest implementation of Microsoft Azure in Africa &ndash; which puts Entelect at the forefront of cloud computing worldwide.\n\nOur three biggest Software clients for 2010 were Discovery (Health, Invest and Life), Standard Bank CIB (who have been with us for many years), and Liberty (Health and Life). We ran custom development projects for about 25 active clients at any one time, with a healthy spread of JAVA and .NET projects. Besides servicing the South African market, one of our strategic intents is to deliver outsourced software solutions to international clients. In this respect we welcome on board Hollard in Australia as a client, who we have no doubt we will have a long and mutually beneficial relationship with.\n\nEntelect Online, which is now in its second year of operation, grew from 50 to 150 client installations in 2010.

We do believe that we have some unique value propositions, so look forward to delivering on these. This business is maturing with the appointment of our first four Resellers who include Entelect ERP (a Sage reseller), Cyclenation (Australia), Advendurance and Baobab International. \n\nEntelect Placements continues to deliver solid results with a comfortable 5% of turnover despite a small team. We expect steady growth for 2011 and will focus on the delivery of quality professional people to our clients.\n\nEntelect Training, which is in its infancy, will be taking a grassroots approach by launching a distance learning solution for school children in the next couple of months. The focus will be on laying the foundations with maths and over time will lead into tertiary level training for software engineers. Of course, we will continue to provide customised training courses for our Software clients and partners.\n\nOur investment in research and development will be significant this year, and we look forward to delivering innovative software solutions to large, medium and small enterprises, both locally and abroad, so expect a few exciting announcements down the line.\n\nWe wish all our clients and partners a profitable and healthy year ahead!&quot;}">Entelect&rsquo;s rebranding exercise was a success.

We had a difficult 2010 as a result of a couple of sizable project delays beyond our control, but closed off the year well with the start of a few big projects, in particular Liberty BurnjOules &ndash; an online loyalty programme for Liberty Health. This is a full software outsource to Entelect and with version 1 launch now complete, we understand it is the single biggest implementation of Microsoft Azure in Africa &ndash; which puts Entelect at the forefront of cloud computing worldwide.<br /><br />Our three biggest Software clients for 2010 were Discovery (Health, Invest and Life), Standard Bank CIB (who have been with us for many years), and Liberty (Health and Life). We ran custom development projects for about 25 active clients at any one time, with a healthy spread of JAVA and .NET projects. Besides servicing the South African market, one of our strategic intents is to deliver outsourced software solutions to international clients. In this respect we welcome on board Hollard in Australia as a client, who we have no doubt we will have a long and mutually beneficial relationship with.<br /><br />Entelect Online, which is now in its second year of operation, grew from 50 to 150 client installations in 2010. Although this business currently only constitutes about 5% of our turnover, it is showing great long term growth potential, following the international trend towards the &ldquo;software as a service&rdquo; model. We do believe that we have some unique value propositions, so look forward to delivering on these. This business is maturing with the appointment of our first four Resellers who include Entelect ERP (a Sage reseller), Cyclenation (Australia), Advendurance and Baobab International. <br /><br />Entelect Placements continues to deliver solid results with a comfortable 5% of turnover despite a small team. We expect steady growth for 2011 and will focus on the delivery of quality professional people to our clients.<br /><br />Entelect Training, which is in its infancy, will be taking a grassroots approach by launching a distance learning solution for school children in the next couple of months. The focus will be on laying the foundations with maths and over time will lead into tertiary level training for software engineers. Of course, we will continue to provide customised training courses for our Software clients and partners.<br /><br />Our investment in research and development will be significant this year, and we look forward to delivering innovative software solutions to large, medium and small enterprises, both locally and abroad, so expect a few exciting announcements down the line.<br /><br />We wish all our clients and partners a profitable and healthy year ahead!</td>

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&lsquo;Every year we handpick and hire about 20 of the top BSc Computer Science, Engineering and BCom Information Systems graduates from all mainstream universities around the country for the Graduate BootCamp. The graduates attend intensive training for two months while on full salaries. After this, they work on client projects free of charge for three months under the mentorship of our team leads. At the end of this period, clients are given the opportunity to retain them on our projects at our standard junior rates,&rsquo; says Entelect MD, Shashi Hansjee.\n Entelect CEO, Dr Charles Pritchard &lsquo;Our clients benefit as they get to work with the country&rsquo;s top graduates on a risk-free basis for an initial period before they commit. Our graduates escalate their technical careers, while our seniors also benefit personally from from helping junior colleagues in the specialist areas that they are most passionate about.&rsquo;\n The BootCamp course covers both the practical and theoretical side of business analysis, programming concepts, Microsoft.NET, Java Enterprise Edition and SQL development. All graduates work through this full syllabus, regardless of which solutions stream they will be working on, giving them a rounded understanding of the full software development life cycle. &lsquo;By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they will have collaborated to write components of systems in various languages and platforms, all of which would have been vetted and code-reviewed by various technical leads,&rsquo; says Hansjee. \n &lsquo;Of course there is a downside risk. It takes us about a year to recover our investment in each graduate, so if the graduate leaves early, we lose financially. That said, it&rsquo;s a risk with which we are comfortable as we go to great lengths to live up to our goal of being the best company in South Africa to work for. Despite the high demand for engineers, we manage to maintain high staff retention rates &ndash; not an easy task considering the dynamics of the industry,&rsquo; says Pritchard. \n Entelect&rsquo;s client base is amongst the best blue-chips in South Africa. Their appetite for the development of big custom systems that differentiate them in the marketplace keeps climbing, hence the demand for software engineers. The culture of ongoing training and mentorship that spans more than 15 career-enhancement programmes, is a real differentiator for Entelect employees. These range from leadership programmes to technology accelerators and specialist technical forums.\n  \n Asked about the current state of skills in South Africa, Pritchard says, &lsquo;There is a severe shortage of high-end software engineering skills in this country. Our problem is not the pursuit of new projects as word gets out that we consistently do a great job but instead, one of finding quality engineers to help us deliver on our order pipeline. If we could hire 30 people today, we would take them! Technology is becoming such an integral part of everyone&rsquo;s lives, and businesses simply cannot run without an innovation focus in this industry. We believe investing more in quality software engineering training programmes as a national priority, and if we don&rsquo;t embrace it as an industry and government collective, we as a nation will lose out on the significant employment opportunities available in the IT sector.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The keynote was on the architecture and infrastructure of SQL Azure&hellip; or whatever it&rsquo;s named this week. The architecture is fascinating, as is their attitude to failure. They use commodity hardware, not server-grade hardware. This naturally makes failures more common. They expect failure and they actually plan for it.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a very different design from most on-premises data centres, where a failure is a major problem. With the Azure data centres, a hardware failure may be left unattended to for up to two weeks. The architecture is built around the concept of &lsquo;self-healing&rsquo;. Servers that fail are simply left until the next scheduled maintenance. Any databases that are affected by the failed server have a new replica built, completely transparently. There&rsquo;s a complex quorum mechanism to ensure that only up-to-date replicas are used. Writes are done to all replicas and reads can be done from any synchronised replica.\n\nAfter the keynote (and fresh coffee), Denny Cherry dived into SQL Server&rsquo;s Availability Groups, detailing the features, limitations and improvements in SQL 2014. He also covered a few case studies, implementations of both the SQL 2012 version and the SQL 2014 version. A complete start-to-finish demo of setting up an Availability Group finished that session.\n\nAfter Denny&rsquo;s session, it was final checks and rehearsal for my first session.This session on database corruption was to a fairly small audience. Lots and lots of questions though &ndash; I ended up skipping the last couple of slides because of all the questions!\n\n\n\nWhich reminds me, I still need to check whether the statement in Books Online, which states that checksum is always enabled for compressed backups, is actually correct&hellip; I have a vague recollection that either the statement is incorrect or there are some other caveats. By the time I finished with all the questions and discussions afterwards, the last session of the day was well underway and both sessions I wanted to go to were full &ndash; thankfully, there are always the recordings! Instead, I ended up spending the rest of the afternoon chatting with Brent Ozar and a few other MVPs in the coffee area, so it wasn't all bad.\n\nFriday evening was the SQLBits party. The steampunk theme was appropriate for a conference venue, which is near to where the industrial revolution began. Long coats, hats and goggles were in abundance. While some made just a token attempt at a costume, some came decked out to the nines.\n\nSaturday started with a session on T-SQL tricks by Itzik Ben-Gan. Itzik is always full of fun new techniques and this session was no exception. All of the tips were around the Windowing functions (Row_Number, Rank, etc.) along with their SQL 2012 enhancements, LEAD, LAG and the window bounds definitions. Half of the tips he showed us were ways of handling complicated &lsquo;gaps and islands&rsquo; type problems, where a data set has a sequential series of numbers with gaps, and the rows need to be &lsquo;grouped&rsquo; into sets delimited by the gaps in the sequence. This used to be a very difficult problem before the introduction of the windowing functions but now it&rsquo;s fairly trivial.\n\nAfter Itzik&rsquo;s session, it was time for final prep (and more coffee) for my session on problematic execution plans. I thought this session went very well, better than the corruption one &ndash; the room was packed. There weren&rsquo;t too many questions, which was good as there was a lot of material to get through. That said, there were quite a few questions after the session, so I missed Steve Jones&rsquo; session, which I&rsquo;d hoped to attend&hellip; more recordings to get!\n\nAfter lunch, it was time to sit in Brent Ozar&rsquo;s session on hardware choices for SQL Server. He made some very valid points about SANs no longer being the only option for high-end SQL Server machines, something that should be kept in mind when planning new servers. SANs are expensive and, if not configured properly for SQL Server, can become a serious bottleneck. With the price of enterprise-grade SSDs dropping and the improvements in SMB 3, internal storage or a NAS built with SSDs may be comparable in price with a SAN but they perform much better. Staying to chat with Brett about hardware and his experiences with large corporates meant I missed the last session. Still, the sessions are all recorded and the chat with Brett was really valuable. By the end of the day, the strain was getting to some&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t help that the demand on the coffee machines had resulted in three out of the four breaking down. \n\nAll in all, it was a very well-run, well-organised conference, with interesting sessions and good presenters. Because all the sessions were recorded (video camera and desktop capture) it meant there wasn&rsquo;t massive pressure to attend a session if there was an opportunity instead to chat directly with any of the (many) MVPs and MCMs who were there.&quot;}">The keynote was on the architecture and infrastructure of SQL Azure&hellip; or whatever it&rsquo;s named this week.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Primarily, DevDay is a platform for staff collaboration and the promotion of unique ideas. The day focuses on employees&rsquo; pet projects and any projects they are interested in in their spare time. There are also demonstrations of new and exciting frameworks, discussions around the technologies used on projects as well as the process around development or operations. \n\nFor the first time, DevDay was extended to include presentation stands and specialist speakers on a wide range of topics. The day was incredibly beneficial to all who attended &ndash; below is some feedback from attendees and speakers.\n\n\nName: Rushil O&rsquo;Jageer \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nI am always excited to attend the Entelect DevDays. DevDays give me the opportunity to learn about all the innovative stuff I&rsquo;m not exposed to on a daily basis, giving me a foundation from which I can work and explore further. The fact that we get 1-UP points for attending also helps. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D Program Rishal presented and the cool technologies you can use to create CMS, presented by Matt. Rishal stood out as the best presenter &ndash; his delivery was so engaging that I lost all track of time. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more around mobile development.\n\nName: Charles Okot \nDesignation: Software Engineer\nI see DevDay as an opportunity to get together with teams we barely come into contact with and see all the innovative stuff everyone else is busy with. I learned so much from this DevDay &ndash; there are plenty of things we don&rsquo;t know about! I thought the full CMS and that 3D Programming is available in the browsing was awesome! For me, Matt stood out as the best speaker and his presentation was very impressive. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more cutting-edge ways in which we can do our jobs. \n\nName: Megan Van Rooyen \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nThis was my first DevDay and it was a great chance for people to show off the innovations they are busy with outside of work and boots. The 3D GS, Web GL and Team Building presentations impressed me. I learned how to use JavaScript Libraries and Browser-use, too. For me, Rishal stood out as the best presenter. He presented on new innovations in a way that everyone could understand. For the next DevDay, I would like to see something on Oculus Rift and Google Phone Blocks. \n\nName: Joe Niemand \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nDevDay gives me time to join the rest of the team and find out all about new technologies and calibration. It&rsquo;s an incredible chance to learn and also get some 1-UP points in one go! The presentation &lsquo;What Makes a Successful Team&rsquo; was brilliant. I learned what it takes to be a charismatic leader, which is a key factor in any successful team. For the next DevDay, I would like to see even more of the innovative ideas presented at every DevDay! \n\nName: Gail Shaw \nDesignation: Technical Lead \nDevDay is a break from the ordinary, giving people the opportunity to showcase &lsquo;not-so-serious&rsquo; presentations in a less formal setting. I enjoy attending DevDay because I am able to gain more presentation experience and practice, which helps me to improve on my presenting skills. I was impressed with the automatic movie downloader and also came to realise that I can&rsquo;t read code! Rishal stood out as the best presenter &ndash; not only is he engaging but his knowledge is also very impressive. For the next DevDay, I would like to see anything ground-breaking and cutting-edge. \n\nName: Chester Cobus \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nI see DevDay as an opportunity to learn all about new technologies and I looked forward to the awesome presentations and technologies that were covered during the day. I learned so much from the presentations on 3D technology, 3D games in JavaScript and light control through a website. It was amazing stuff! Rishal stood out as the best presenter because his enthusiasm and passion is contagious! For the next DevDay, I would to see more around mobile technology. \n\nName: Lwazi Prusent \nDesignation: Software Engineer \nI like attending DevDay because we get to learn about new things, new frameworks and then of course, there are always the gourmet milkshakes at the end! I was blown away by the Web GL, the JavaScript Libraries and the Automatic Movie Downloader. Gail stood out as the best presenter. I think she&rsquo;s witty and canny, and I think PSOs are so cool! For the next DevDay, I would like to see a greater focus on gaming. \n\nName: Jonathan Counihan \nDesignation: Team Lead \nDevDay gives us the chance to learn about new projects, listen to interesting topics and socialise with teams we don&rsquo;t get to see very often. Earning 1-UP points for attending is another added bonus. The Android Development and the 3D Programming JavaScript presentations were great. I also got some useful ideas for team success and where to use node. I enjoyed listening to Matt and Trevor &ndash; both of them really grabbed and held my attention. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more external speakers and a focus on topics such as the insightful teambuilding presentation by Trevor. \n\nName: Janine Coelho \nDesignation: Senior Software Engineer\nI love being a part of the DevDay crew, which means I am at every DevDay listening to some very cool interesting talks. The Al-SQL, teambuilding and gaming development talks were phenomenal. Trevor stood out as the best presenter because he was engaging and gave an insightful teambuilding talk. For the next DevDay, I would like to see any new innovations. \n\nName: Rishal Hurbans \nDesignation: Team Lead \nDevDay, gives us the opportunity to share knowledge with one another and as I want to share my knowledge, I like to present&hellip; which means that I have to be there! I thoroughly enjoyed the information on the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s and all its uses &ndash; MINDBLOWING! Justin stood out as the best presenter because he delivered a stimulating and thoughtful presentation, which was truly inspiring. For the next DevDay, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing more of the same topics &ndash; innovation all the way! \n\nYet again, DevDay was hugely successful.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The big conference in the SQL Server world is the PASS Summit. In previous years, the conference boasted more than 5,000 attendees. Back in its usual haunt of Seattle, this year&rsquo;s PASS Summit promises three days of the best technical sessions available. With more than 200 technical sessions across three days, there is nothing else like it. As usual, there will be too much material packed into too little time, but all the sessions will be recorded and attendees can download them free of charge, so missing a session is not a major problem.\n\nI&rsquo;m presenting a 400-level session (classified &lsquo;Expert&rsquo; level) on the Friday afternoon. The session is on the internals of one aspect of the Query Optimiser &ndash; the Cardinality Estimator. The presentation is an expanded version of the one I did for the 24 Hours of PASS Summit Preview and goes into detail on how SQL Server estimates the number of rows that will be affected by a query operator, how it uses statistics to get accurate row estimations and what happens when it can&rsquo;t use the statistics. The idea of the presentation is that once people know how SQL Server generates the row estimations, they&rsquo;re much better equipped to solve problems when they encounter queries with incorrect row estimations. The session will be shown on PASStv and so anyone, whether they&rsquo;re attending or not, can watch it.\n\nThis year, PASS Summit is not the only conference in early November in Seattle. Microsoft has moved its MVP Summit from its usual February/March timeframe to the same week as PASS Summit. The MVP Summit is a private conference for the recipients of Microsoft&rsquo;s Most Valuable Professional award.\n\nThe MVP Summit is an opportunity to sit with the SQL Server development team for presentations on future plans and upcoming features. Everything during the MVP summit is under NDA, including the agenda, so unfortunately, no details can be given on what will be shown and discussed there.\n\nTo make it a triple punch, Red Gate is holding the Seattle leg of its SQL in the City mini-conference during the same week. SQL in the City is a technical conference with a dash of marketing. It&rsquo;s run by Red Gate and there are sessions that promote their tools but not all sessions are marketing related. That said, even the ones that aren&rsquo;t, are usually completely marketing focused!\n\nThis year I&rsquo;m co-presenting a (hopefully) half-humorous, half-serious, zero-marketing session on transaction log management entitled &lsquo;You did WHAT to my transaction log?!?!?!?&rsquo; in which Tony Davis and I look at the various ways people mismanage their logs, the consequences of doing this and what the recommended practices are for log management.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a long road to Seattle&hellip; but it&rsquo;s well worth it for the wealth of knowledge available to everyone attending the three conferences.&quot;}">The big conference in the SQL Server world is the PASS Summit.

Successes include putting a number of children through school, weekly mentorship by staff volunteers, issuing study scholarships, assisting families financially, running a feeding scheme for unemployed people; sponsorship of a new graphic design centre at the Frances Vorwerg school for the disabled, and donating 45 percent of the shares of Entelect's contracting company to a community development education trust.\n The hosting of many more events by the company's social committee throughout the year, from braais and sports events to family days.\n  \nBefore closing off the day&rsquo;s proceedings, Pritchard congratulated the top 1Up contenders for their efforts in going beyond the call of duty for Entelect, with the winning employee announced as Warren Bonn. In closing, Pritchard made special mention of Managing Director Shashi Hansjee, announcing that Hansjee will be taking over as CEO. Pritchard praised Hansjee saying, &ldquo;Shashi joined Entelect in 2005 as a software engineer and has had an illustrious career at Entelect since. In a short space of time he was leading big projects, was promoted to technical director and later managing director.&rdquo; Pritchard noted, &ldquo;Shashi was particularly successful in his role as MD because he is prepared to do operations and administrative work as well as set the direction for the business, and most importantly, he understands people. He has done a brilliant job in selecting and nurturing our current management team, and until recently, he made the time to see every single employee in regular performance reviews &ndash; something very few MDs of a company this size would and could do. Today, I can say with confidence that Shashi runs the ship, and will continue to run and steer the Entelect in the right direction.&rdquo; \n\nPritchard continued, &ldquo;It is for this reason that I am bidding farewell to my position as CEO and am officially handing over the reins to Shashi today! I will be staying on as chairman of the board, and of course will always be involved with Entelect and will continue to provide guidance and support to our management team.&rdquo; Pritchard closed off by announcing that his next personal mission is to help people get closer to God and to further help the poor of South Africa. He explained, &ldquo;In October last year, I was graced with a vision of Christ on the cross, which has had a profound effect on my life over the last year and literally has lit the fire in my heart to pursue this mission with God at its centre.&rdquo; He affirmed, &ldquo;I feel that the company&rsquo;s success is purely as a result of God&rsquo;s grace because of the way we conduct our business &ndash; with integrity and in true service of others, be it towards staff, clients or our extended communities &ndash; and is the reason why Entelect will continue to be successful in the future.&rdquo; \n\nHansjee thanked Pritchard for his contributions and noted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see our founder using his time and resources to do good&rdquo;. He added that this will be a seamless transition, and that Entelect&rsquo;s strong management team will continue to drive the business forward. Hansjee says that Entelect will continue developing its presence as the place to be for South Africa&rsquo;s top software talent, with further emphasis on showcasing Entelect&rsquo;s technical capability.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;A Technology Accelerator project is a software project that must be developed to achieve a predefined outcome, for example to learn a new technology, showcase a framework, solve a business problem, complete a fully specified system or create a potential product. Employees are given time during working their week to work on their Technology Accelerator projects. They have the full support of Entelect senior managers and technical leads, who guide and mentor them through the process. Employees can also join forces and work together on single projects. Employees can join the programme at any time from the beginning of the year but the projects must be completed and ready to present to a judging panel by mid-October. \n\nJudging this year was held at the African Pride Hotel in Melrose Arch, where renowned tech journalist Nafisa Akabor and TechHuman.com editor Brendon Ambrose joined the Entelect senior management judges &ndash; Shashi Hansjee (CEO), Yatish Parshotam (GM: Communications), Sheldon Lyne (GM: Operations) and Matthew Butler (GM: Projects). Each participant was given 15 minutes to present their projects and these projects were judged on technology innovation, complexity, completeness and quality of presentation, among other criteria. Scores were tallied and the results and prizes were handed out at Entelect&rsquo;s year-end function at the Askari Lodge (http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=43012). \n\nThe winner of the best group project was handed to project &ldquo;Beep&rdquo; by Rishal Hurbans, Rushil O&rsquo;Jageer and Ross Badenhorst, and the team took away a prize of R30,000 to share. Beep is a highly extensible notifications framework that provides real-time notifications of new content from various sources. The prize for the best individual project went to the Projects Dashboard, which is already used at Entelect HQ to track the health of the builds of our various projects. Duane McKibbin walked away with a prize of R15000. The second place prize of R10000 went to Grant Marais&rsquo; JavaScript music visualiser, Pulsar. All other participants received R1000 worth of 1Up points (Entelect&rsquo;s internal rewards programme).  \n This was the first year that Entelect has run this programme and it was a huge success.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The trio of conferences started on the Sunday morning with the MVP Summit. This is Microsoft&rsquo;s annual gathering of MVPs, where the company shows off new and upcoming features of its products and elicits comments, suggestions and criticisms from the MVPs. In the case of the SQL group, there&rsquo;s often a lot of criticism! While everything discussed during the MVP summit is under NDA (which results in some amusing tweets during the conference), some of the highlights of the conference have since been announced publically and so can be discussed. These include:  Sharding for Windows Azure SQL Database (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/frcogno/archive/2014/11/04/sneak-peek-horizontal-scale-using-azure-sql-database-elastic-scale-preview-day-1.aspx)\n Updatable, non-clustered columnstore indexes, including for Hekaton tables\n Stretching tables from a physical SQL installation to Azure SQL DB (http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2014/11/06/pass-summit-keynote.aspx).\n  \nOn the Monday, Red Gate ran the Seattle leg of its SQL in the City. These mini-conferences are a mixture of technical training and marketing material and there&rsquo;s usually a good balance between the two. Tony Davis (editor for Red Gate Software) and I presented a technical session entitled &lsquo;You did WHAT to my transaction log?!?!?&rsquo; The session aimed to show just how bad things can become if people try quick solutions to log growth, without bothering to understand how the log is used and how it works.\nThe annual PASS Summit started with a bang on the Wednesday morning, but fizzled out with the boring, marketing-focused keynote that followed. One of these days we will have technical keynotes on both days, but until then&hellip; As an aside, Chris Webb&rsquo;s blog post on some of the reasons why the Wednesday keynote was badly received makes for an interesting and enlightening read.\n\nAs expected, nothing major was announced at the PASS Summit because we are halfway through a development cycle for SQL Server &ndash; no dates were given for vNext. There were some Windows Azure SQL Database announcements (unfortunately these did not include a shorter name for it), but they did include sharding and some hints as to the features that will be in vNext. These could incorporate updatable, nonclustered columnstore indexes and stretch tables to Windows Azure SQL Database.\n\nWithout much effort, the rest of Wednesday far exceeded the keynote in interest. Buck Woody discussed relevant data storage options, making the very, very important point that not everything should be shoehorned into a single solution just because that is the hammer. If part of an application&rsquo;s data persistence fits naturally into a document database and half into a graph database, that is where they should go, and they shouldn&rsquo;t both be crammed into something inappropriate.\n\nConor Cunningham, architect on the SQL team, introduced a feature for SQL Server vNext, called the Query Store. In a nutshell, Query Store is a persisted record of query performance, broken down by object and query and user-chosen interval. This feature will, in most cases, make it unnecessary to run trace/extended events sessions to capture a system&rsquo;s query workload, because it will be done continually in the background. Its best feature is that since it&rsquo;s persisted, a database backup will contain all the Query Store information with no additional work required.\n\nThursday started with a technical keynote from Dr Rimma Nehme, who works at the Microsoft Jim Gray Systems Lab. She gave an excellent technical presentation on cloud computing &mdash; for the record, she says we should blame the network people for the name &lsquo;Cloud&rsquo;. The rest of the day was just as good, with Paul Randal talking about advanced recovery options (including using hex editors on database files) and Bob Ward spending three hours talking about SQL Server IO.\n\nBy Friday, although many delegates were worn out, there was still a good-size audience for my session on the cardinality estimator. However, the later scheduling of the session could have been the reason for there being fewer questions and interaction than I would have liked. That said, all in all, the three conferences made another excellent week of technical training, friendship and learning.&quot;}">The trio of conferences started on the Sunday morning with the MVP Summit.

The only traces and event sessions that are enabled by default are a default trace and a very light-weight system health extended events session. SQL tracks query performance stats but only in an aggregated form. Aggregated since the query plan was cached, which for a frequently run query could be just after the server started.

However, with the Query Store, SQL automatically tracks the run-time performance characteristics of queries, including CPU usage, duration, reads, row count, degree of parallelism and memory usage.

Not using complex WITH PLAN hints or by creating plan guides, but simply by associating a query ID, from the Query Store, with a plan ID, also from the Query Store.

Along with a number of local and other international speakers, I&rsquo;ll be giving a presentation there. I&rsquo;ll be talking about database corruption, what should be done to ensure that a DBA is prepared if corruption strikes and what the DBA should do if a database really does become corrupt. The presentation covers backup strategies and the need for tested backups, options for consistency checks, monitoring and alerts. It also covers what a DBA should, and most importantly shouldn&rsquo;t do, should the database become corrupt.\n\nThe week following SQLSaturday Vienna is the SQL Bits conference.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The need for more tech-savvy employees, who possess the required skill sets to effectively work in dynamic, highly technical environments, has increased exponentially. &lsquo;However, while Africa offers boundless opportunities within the ICT space, there is a critical skills shortage, particularly in South Africa when compared to our counterparts across Africa,&rsquo; explains Tim Kroon, General Manager of Resourcing at Entelect. &lsquo;With a youth unemployment rate of more than one-third of young South Africans, mainly as a result of a lack of skills, we are seeing some compelling efforts from the private sector to improve ICT education levels and attract more young people to a field that provides opportunities across every business sector.&rsquo; \n\n&lsquo;Various companies and institutions have set up ICT-focussed educational funds and charities, skills development programmes and upskilling incentives,&rsquo; says Kroon. Among the most successful of these is Entelect&rsquo;s annual R100K Challenge, supported by partners Sony Mobile and NAG magazine. Now in its fourth year, the R100K Challenge hopes to encourage students to pursue a career in ICT, as well as help professional programmers to continuously learn and develop their own skills. Kroon elaborates, &lsquo;There are specific skills required to take part in a challenge such as this, which we hope will encourage more young people to improve their skills within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, with a view towards entering the ICT skills arena once their studies are complete.&rsquo; \n\nKroon goes on to explain that the R100K Challenge plays an important role in attracting people to the local development community. He says that it presents a compelling incentive to student or novice coders and professional developers alike. This year, the R100K Challenge&rsquo;s retro-gaming theme of Space Invaders is specifically designed to test the artificial intelligence (AI) skills of entrants in a face-off competition, where candidates are required to write the code for their own designed bot. &lsquo;The necessary skills to win the R100K Challenge are relevant to the industry at large. Winning requires not only the ability to write the code, but also to think strategically. Entrants will need to engage their skills of critical analysis and a structured process of testing and optimisation,&rsquo; says Kroon. As the competition grows each year, so it is modified to cater to its entrants. For example, this year the Player Portal has been launched. Here, players are able to upload their code and test it properly, offering the chance to iron out any flaws. These elements are reflective of the industry and could help prepare entrants for making the leap into the marketplace of software engineering, where professionals are primarily responsible for writing, designing and testing of computer programs. \n\nWith the global ICT industry now producing trillions of rands&rsquo; worth of value within a myriad of industries, Kroon says that it is Entelect&rsquo;s hope that the increasingly popular R100K Challenge will continue to encourage and introduce more young people to the field of programming and development, and that it will highlight the massive opportunities for them in this essential industry. &lsquo;Choosing to study within the field of ICT disciplines puts students at a great advantage when entering the marketplace, while simultaneously improving South Africa&rsquo;s capabilities and economic outlook,&rsquo; says Kroon. &lsquo;There are significant professional benefits to mastering computer programming topics, such as logic, patterns and problem solving. For students moving into computer science at tertiary level, having a background or introduction to computer programming at a high-school level will, of course, be a distinct advantage.&rsquo; \n\nThe increase in local skills will play an important role in enhancing South Africa&rsquo;s competitiveness on the global ICT stage. This will promote job creation and the opportunity for South Africa to ensure the country is able to depend on its own local products and services to meet its ICT needs, rather than outsourcing skills from other countries. It may even create the capacity for South Africa to export these skills.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The SQLSaturday events are free, one-day mini-conferences hosted by the various SQL Server usergroups across the world. So far there have been 400 SQL Saturday events across six continents.\n\nOn the 28 February, the Austrian SQL Server usergroups hosted SQL Saturday in Vienna. There were more than 300 attendees from all across Austria and beyond. My presentation on database corruption had a large and enthusiastic audience.\n\nThe database corruption session is mostly about things that DBAs can do so that if their database ever does become corrupt, they can recover easily. The focus of the presentation is around backups, recovery plan, monitoring and alerts. The second part is on what to do if corruption is detected, and the focus there is on understanding the errors and ensuring that actions taken don&rsquo;t make the problem worse.\n\nThe keynote was given by Mark Souza of Microsoft&rsquo;s Customer Advisory Team, who discussed a number of features that may or may not be coming in future versions of SQL Server.\n\nAfter SQL Saturday, it was time to make the trip across Europe to London for the SQL Bits conference. I had two accepted sessions for the conference: a regular session on transactions and a double-length session on indexes.\n\nThe session on transactions had a small but attentive audience. In it, I covered the concept of atomicity and how transactions guarantee atomicity. I also looked at how locks locks interact with transactions and ended with an examination of error handling and the necessarily of catching errors that can occur within transactions.\n\nThe indexing session was full, standing-room only! The session covered index architecture in brief, touching on how index trees work. A good understanding of index architecture often makes figuring out how and why SQL uses particular indexes easy. Despite some minor AV problems, the session went spectacularly: attentive audience, good questions, great feedback, even if I did find a mistake on one of the slides. With index architecture out of the way, I spent the rest of the session looking at design considerations for the clustered index and then looking at how the queries that run against a table will affect the nonclustered indexes chosen for it. The video recording of the session is available on the SQLBits site.\n\nAll in all, it was another very successful SQLBits conference and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next one.&quot;}">The SQLSaturday events are free, one-day mini-conferences hosted by the various SQL Server usergroups across the world. So far there have been 400 SQL Saturday events across six continents.<br /><br />On the 28 February, the Austrian SQL Server usergroups hosted SQL Saturday in Vienna. There were more than 300 attendees from all across Austria and beyond. My presentation on database corruption had a large and enthusiastic audience.<br /><br />The database corruption session is mostly about things that DBAs can do so that if their database ever does become corrupt, they can recover easily. The focus of the presentation is around backups, recovery plan, monitoring and alerts. The second part is on what to do if corruption is detected, and the focus there is on understanding the errors and ensuring that actions taken don&rsquo;t make the problem worse.<br /><br />The keynote was given by Mark Souza of Microsoft&rsquo;s Customer Advisory Team, who discussed a number of features that may or may not be coming in future versions of SQL Server.<br /><br />After SQL Saturday, it was time to make the trip across Europe to London for the SQL Bits conference. I had two accepted sessions for the conference: a regular session on transactions and a double-length session on indexes.<br /><br />The session on transactions had a small but attentive audience. In it, I covered the concept of atomicity and how transactions guarantee atomicity. I also looked at how locks locks interact with transactions and ended with an examination of error handling and the necessarily of catching errors that can occur within transactions.<br /><br />The indexing session was full, standing-room only! The session covered index architecture in brief, touching on how index trees work. A good understanding of index architecture often makes figuring out how and why SQL uses particular indexes easy. Despite some minor AV problems, the session went spectacularly: attentive audience, good questions, great feedback, even if I did find a mistake on one of the slides. With index architecture out of the way, I spent the rest of the session looking at design considerations for the clustered index and then looking at how the queries that run against a table will affect the nonclustered indexes chosen for it. The video recording of the session is available on the SQLBits site.<br /><br />All in all, it was another very successful SQLBits conference and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next one.</td>

They provide high-quality training run entirely by volunteers. To date, there have been more than 400 SQLSaturday events on six continents since the first one was held in Orlando in late 2007.\n This will be the fifth year in a row that there&rsquo;s a SQLSaturday held in Johannesburg. However, it&rsquo;s the first year that we have three events running in South Africa.\n \nJohannesburg is up first on 5 September. I&rsquo;m presenting several sessions there: a full day preconference session on the Friday, as well as two sessions on the Saturday. The precon is titled &lsquo;All about Execution Plans&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;ll be talking the entire day on execution plans, starting with how and why they are generated, and ending with a detailed look at the operators that can appear in the plans, what they mean and how to read them.\n \nThe first session on the Saturday, titled &lsquo;What backups?&rsquo;, covers SQL&rsquo;s backup options, the full, differential and log backups, what they each do and when they&rsquo;d be used, as well as a discussion on restore paths for different kinds of backup. The second session on the Saturday is a more advanced session called &lsquo;Lies, damned lies and statistics&rsquo;. It looks at SQL&rsquo;s statistics objects, what they are and what they are used for. It goes into detail on the part that the statistics play in the optimisation process and what can (and will) go wrong when statistics are out of date.\n  \n The second Saturday of September sees SQLSaturday moving to Cape Town. Again, I&rsquo;ll be delivering my talk on statistics.To complete the trio, on the 19 September, the very first SQLSaturday Durban will be held. In addition to the sessions on backups and statistics, I&rsquo;m also doing a two-hour presentation on execution plans. The first half is focussed on how to read execution plans and the second, on using the execution plan to identify performance problems with queries.\n \nTo end the month on a very different note, I have the pleasure of presenting an AI paper at the SAICSIT conference in Stellenbosch &hellip; a change from the usual SQL conferences indeed.&quot;}">The SQLSaturday conferences are free, one-day conferences, and as their name suggests, usually on a Saturday (though Hawaii ran its conference on a Friday), run by the local SQL Server usergroups.

There are hundreds of sessions and thousands of attendees and it is held over a three-day period, usually in late October or early November. In addition to the three main conference days, there are two days of precon seminars, which offer full-day training courses on specific topics.\n  \n  \n The main conference starts on the Wednesday morning with a keynote by Microsoft. This has often been where Microsoft announces releases or major features. This year, I won&rsquo;t be at all surprised if there&rsquo;s an announcement regarding SQL Server 2016 &ndash; perhaps its expected release date. There may very well also be Azure announcements, either around the database offering or on any of the many BI, Big Data and Machine Learning features that Azure offers. Whatever is announced, it&rsquo;s sure to be a keynote not to be missed. As for the rest of the conference, it&rsquo;s all about sharing and learning. Some of the sessions I&rsquo;m especially looking forward to are:\n  \n  \n  Itzik Ben-Gan talking about running totals. Itzik knows more about T-SQL than most of us have forgotten, and his sessions are always enjoyable\n Bob Ward, in his famous level 500 internals session talking about wait types, latches and spinlocks\n Advanced analytics with R in SQL Server 2016. R is a fascinating language, and one I&rsquo;ve just recently started learning. R in SQL Server? Bring it!\n   \n  \n The sessions aren&rsquo;t the only part of the PASS Summit, though. There&rsquo;s the SQL Clinic where the top CSS engineers will be available to help with any SQL Server problems. There is also the Customer Advisory Team that can help with designs for SQL implementations and features big and small, and there&rsquo;s the community area where there&rsquo;s sure to be several SQL professionals at any time, willing to share their knowledge.\n  \n  \n The Friday keynote is going to be a treat. Dr DeWitt, from the Jim Grey lab has given the last-day keynote on multiple occasions, always to critical acclaim and usually to a standing ovation.

This year, they will present the final-day keynote together on the Internet of Things (IoT).\n  \n  \n The week after PASS Summit, the action moves across the lakes to Bellevue and Redmond, for Microsoft&rsquo;s annual MVP Summit.

Everything that occurs during the MVP summit is under NDA (including the lunch menu) but that just means that Microsoft is free to talk about things that the company is not ready to make public. It also gives the the MVPs a chance comment on, and often criticise, those plans. \n\nWhile the agenda is NDA, what I&rsquo;m expecting and hoping to see is a mixture of features coming in SQL 2016 and longer-term plans for the future of SQL Server and entire data platform as a whole.\n  \n  \n All in all, between PASS and the MVP summit, it&rsquo;s going to be a busy, but great, trip.&quot;}">To me, late October means one thing: it&rsquo;s time for back-to-back conferences in Seattle, specifically the PASS Summit and the MVP Summit, with a couple of one-day mini-conferences also thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />PASS Summit is THE conference for SQL Server professionals.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;South Africa has one of the worst youth unemployment problems in the world, with some estimates holding that less than half the population under 35 are employed. The percentage of black African professional, managerial and technical workers aged 25 to 34 has dropped by 2% over the past 20 years, leaving that generation less skilled than previous ones &ndash; and less skilled than every other race and age group, according to a recently survey by Statistics South Africa.\n  \n Little has changed since 2009 when Stats SA last did the survey. As in 2009, 57% of people with less than matric remain unemployed, while those with a matric recorded unchanged unemployment levels of 38%.\n  \n More than 98% of children who should be getting a primary education do attend school - but simply being in school is not enough. We need our children to be educated properly. Only 35% of children in Grade 3 are able to pass the literacy and numeracy tests for that age group. Where are the skills going to come from that we so desperately need to create jobs in SA now and in future generations?\n  \n Business has a clear role to play in improving the situation. Strategically aligned corporate social investment initiatives can go a long way towards educational upliftment in our country. The Entelect Foundation, for example, provides curriculum tutoring, life skills advice and basic support to pupils and their parents in a number of communities in Johannesburg. We spend 10% of all pre-tax profits on school fees and basic expenses such as food and transport for these kids. It might seem like a small contribution when taken in context of the country&rsquo;s dire needs, but for those families who receive the benefits, it means the world.\n  \n As the economy moves from primary and secondary-based to tertiary based, opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled workers will decrease. Many citizens aspire to a university education, seeing it as a cure-all for unemployment. But it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly evident that a back-to-basics approach is needed: a strong focus on equipping South Africans with a solid education from the ground up, particularly when it comes to literacy and numeracy.\n  \n Youth must also be encouraged to complete their schooling by providing them with a quality learning experience. As for tertiary education, youth who choose to study so-called scarce skills, like maths and science, will have the edge in the job market. To help this process, we sit on university advisory boards to help ensure that tertiary education and industry are aligned. More than 30% of our current staff base joined as graduates with no prior work experience.\n  \n Government and business need to work together to improve the employment situation. Government has the scale to reach the young and unemployed and make the long-term commitment needed to educate our children. The business community knows which skills are needed and what it takes to make someone employable.\n  \n There is a mismatch between formal-sector industry expectations and the understanding of first-time workers in terms of professionalism, specifically, timekeeping, etiquette, accountability. Many youth also believe that rising through the ranks is effortless. They are unprepared to start at the bottom and work their way up.\n  \n More businesses should also start focusing on training talented people who lack skills and experience, rather than poaching experienced employees from other companies.\n  \n However, businesses need support to do this. By improving subsidies, tax incentives, BBBEE initiatives as well as a loosening of laws that impede hiring in small businesses, the government can encourage companies to support skills development and job creation, particularly for black South Africans. There are a number of programmes that can assist with this:\n  \n &bull; Encourage businesses to provide input into the way schools are run.

His talk included a breakdown of the design and manufacture of the custom electronics built for the installation, the construction of the artwork itself and the realities of bringing a fancy toy into the middle of the desert.\n &bull; Duncan Gillies and Nicolle Garber discussed data science techniques and approaches while using a BI and visualization tool to simplify the methodology for non-technical users. In an interesting twist he used IMBD&rsquo;s movie data set to try cluster and predict a variety of metrics.\n &bull; Dino Fizzotti whose talk was titled &ldquo;&rsquo;Blink the LED&rsquo; right?&rdquo; covered how he learnt to write software, from making hardware and developed his use his 16shades project.\n &bull; Pieter Koornhof, who, in his lightning talk, looked at why developers should consider working code in production, maintainable code, and having fun, the three most important things in their normal day-to-day.\n  \n As well as a variety of talks, there were a number of interactive exhibition stands. Both House4hack and Sterkinekor contribute to the interactive exhibition with their stands which were greatly appreciated by everyone there.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;We are still very much in the midst of the Digital Revolution. This change to the economy has pushed not only technology companies to the forefront, but also traditional-industry companies who have embraced technology. Many South Africans still do not consider a career in IT a viable option (Educating and empowering the youth), but it&rsquo;s clear that these skills will become more and more integral to the growth of our economy in the future. Who knows, in more developed economies, coding might even become as fundamental to early education as literacy and mathematics.\n So how does one spark a child&rsquo;s interest in coding? Fortunately, there are a huge number of apps and websites dedicated to this nowadays. But just leaving a child in front of a tablet or PC and hoping for the best is unlikely to inspire a real interest. Here are some tips to help them discover their potential:\n  \n 1. Emphasise the creative and fun aspects\n Some of the most satisfying elements of programming are the creative element and the instant gratification behind it. Coding taught in a monotonous academic way often misses out on those elements and results in kids becoming overwhelmed or indifferent. Most children love creating things, and love to see their creations in action &ndash; think painting or Lego. Look for tools that encourage exploration, that enable curiosity (&ldquo;I wonder what will happen if I do this?&rdquo;) and allow the child to actually see the output of what they have just done.\n For very young children, there are Apps such as Bit-by-bit or Fisher Price&rsquo;s Code-a-pillar, and for kids aged 6-10, tools like ScratchJr (web-based), Daisy the Dinosaur (iPad) and HopScotch (iPad) work really well. For slightly older children, Scratch, Lightbot and Tynker (all web-based) are great options while Lego Mindstorms bring a whole new feature to an old classic. For a comprehensive list and reviews of each option, head here: commonsensemedia\n Scratch and Tynker also bring in the gaming element, which is something many kids enjoy. Imagine the pride involved with creating their own computer game.\n  \n 2. Make it social\n Group projects can be even more rewarding, and help both the creative process and ensure that there is immediate support should a child get stuck. Look for mentors &ndash; many families will have a developer in there somewhere who will more than likely be happy to assist. Most developers understand how important coding skills are to our country&rsquo;s future. A good mentor can really make the difference between a prolonged interest and becoming overwhelmed and bored.\n Alternatively, look for local kids coding groups or hackathons. This is an area where South Africa is lacking, but there are a few out there.\n Code.org is an online platform that offers tutorials for elementary school level through to high school level. And Africa Code week offers online courses for 8-11 year olds and upwards; both are designed to teach coding skills to budding young programmers. Locally, Entelect are running a series of Schools engagement programmes, where employees take time to talk to children at schools about possible futures in coding. A number of schools are also starting to incorporate coding into their curriculum, so look out for these opportunities where available.\n  \n 3. Don&rsquo;t force things\n Every child is different. Not all kids like to paint or play sports or read, so not every child will like to code either. Exposing the child to the tools, and showing them enough support to let them make their own mind up is key. If they don&rsquo;t show immediate interest, they at least know what it&rsquo;s all about and may even revisit it at a later stage of their education.\n  \n  \n Introducing children to programming can open up paths for them in the future as these skills become integral to the growth of our economy. The skills they can learn around critical thinking, problem solving and creativity are likely to be beneficial in all sorts of walks of life. The key is to make it enjoyable.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Ryan Louw, a software developer by profession, was announced as the winner of this year&rsquo;s Entelect Challenge competition, the finals of which were played out at rAge Expo on 7 October.\n  \n Louw&rsquo;s bot, &lsquo;Colonel Panic&rsquo;, built in C#, competed in all four rounds of this year&rsquo;s Challenge and stormed to first place, winning him R70,000.\n  \n Based on the hugely popular &lsquo;Battleships&rsquo; classic game, the 2017 Entelect Challenge brought together novice coders and experienced professionals as they competed against each other by coding an artificial intelligence (AI) player, or bot, to challenge other bots.\n  \n Coding and AI hobbyists and enthusiasts have spent the last six months building their bots, with the goal of winning their share of the R200,000 prize bounty.\n  \n The winning strategy\n  \n Louw&rsquo;s bot went into the finals with strong stats:\n &bull; 196 wins out of 263 matches played;\n &bull; 66,220 points won up to the final match; and\n &bull; 5 wins out of 7 clan matches played\n &ldquo;He had one of the strongest player strategies in the competition this year,&rdquo; says Tomislav Ravic, Team Lead for the Entelect Challenge.\n  \n &ldquo;Competing successfully in the Challenge is not about the best or cleanest code,&rdquo; says Ravic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design but its strategy could be highly effective. That&rsquo;s what makes the Entelect Challenge so appealing to coders of all levels.&rdquo;\n  \n Second place went to Dion van Huyssteen, who was awarded R35,000 in prize bounty. Van Huyssteen&rsquo;s bot, &lsquo;Heat Seeking bot&rsquo;, built in C++, actually went into the finals with stronger stats than Louw&rsquo;s bot: 228 wins out of 256 matches and a total of 73,310 points. But, on the day, Louw&rsquo;s strategy was stronger.\n  \n A word from the winners\n  \n This was the third time Louw competed in the Entelect Challenge. &ldquo;My first Challenge was Pacman, then Space Invaders and now Battleships. For me, the best part of the Challenge is to get into the head of your opponent. My strategy this year was helped by the tournament stages; so first, I built a basic shooting strategy, then a weapons strategy, then, in the third round, I had to work out when to use the shield.\n  \n &ldquo;I figured out that I needed to place my bots statically in strategic locations and then I needed to start shooting from the outside-in, not the inside-out, as one would normally think to do.\n  \n &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do very well in the first two rounds, so I wasn&rsquo;t even expecting to get into the finals, but was really surprised to win,&rdquo; says Louw.\n  \n Second place winner, Van Huyssteen, describes his bot strategy: &ldquo;I started with a standard heat-seeking strategy, but as the game went on, I started applying modifiers to that. The initial idea was to modify the heat maps with a bunch of variables, which I could iterate through and automate, but I ran out of time. So, I ended up with something that cleared the edges and then worked its way inwards after that.&rdquo;\n  \n Top awards all round\n  \n Third place went to Anesu Jairosi, who says this was the third time he has entered the Challenge. &ldquo;I hate losing, but I love coding so much, so I&rsquo;ve entered three times now, since Pacman. This year, my strategy was based on probability, specifically where competitors will place their ships. But then I adapted this as I realised a human player will not place their ship in the middle, so I started aiming around the edges.&rdquo;\n  \n Fourth place winner, Jaco Mostert, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every Challenge I&rsquo;ve entered; it&rsquo;s very entertaining just competing in the Challenge and having the chance to write the code. Personally, I don&rsquo;t get a chance to do any AI in my job but it&rsquo;s something I am interested in, so the Challenge allows me the opportunity to play with AI.\n  \n &ldquo;In the second battle, I focused on the side of the map, and gauged the performance and found my bot did a lot better. For the final battle, I scaled it down a bit to focus on the inside a little more but still with a good focus on the outside.&rdquo;\n  \n Sixth place went to Wynand Wolmarans, who won The Battle of Tortuga mini challenge. &ldquo;I quickly realised that a great algorithm alone will not be enough to win the Challenge this year. I spent a lot of time tweaking and adjusting my bot but the most difficult part was choosing and sticking with a strategy because it could blow up in my face at any point. The secret to success is starting with a basic strategy, testing your bot against it and then letting your imagination take over.&rdquo;\n  \n The final rankings in the 2017 competition were as follows:\n 1st Ryan Louw R70,000\n 2nd Dion van Huyssteen R35,000\n 3rd Anesu Jairosi R25,000\n 4th Jaco Mostert R25,000\n 5th Willie Theron R10,000\n 6th Wynand Wolmarans R10,000\n 7th Andre Nel R10,000\n 8th Mark-Anthony Fouche R10,000\n  \n  \n Not everyone has to be a coding wizard\n  \n This year, the competition was structured differently to allow relatively low-level coders the opportunity to enter. The team introduced four tournament battles, each one increasing the level of complexity.\n  \n &ldquo;The staggered strategy component that we introduced to the Challenge this year has been well received by the players, as it gives them a chance to refine and test their bots before entering the playoffs,&rdquo; said Ravic. The result was an increase of more than double the number of participants than last year.\n  \n &ldquo;This year, the hackathons worked really well; people were not only recruiting and challenging others, but also helping others set up their bots. Thanks to these hackathons, participants were able to collaborate and compete on a whole new level. We&rsquo;re looking forward to taking some of these concepts further next year,&rdquo; concluded Ravic.&quot;}">Ryan Louw, a software developer by profession, was announced as the winner of this year&rsquo;s Entelect Challenge competition, the finals of which were played out at rAge Expo on 7 October.<br /><br />Louw&rsquo;s bot, &lsquo;Colonel Panic&rsquo;, built in C#, competed in all four rounds of this year&rsquo;s Challenge and stormed to first place, winning him R70,000.<br /><br />Based on the hugely popular &lsquo;Battleships&rsquo; classic game, the 2017 Entelect Challenge brought together novice coders and experienced professionals as they competed against each other by coding an artificial intelligence (AI) player, or bot, to challenge other bots.<br /><br />Coding and AI hobbyists and enthusiasts have spent the last six months building their bots, with the goal of winning their share of the R200,000 prize bounty.<br /><br />The winning strategy<br /><br />Louw&rsquo;s bot went into the finals with strong stats:<br />&bull; 196 wins out of 263 matches played;<br />&bull; 66,220 points won up to the final match; and<br />&bull; 5 wins out of 7 clan matches played<br />&ldquo;He had one of the strongest player strategies in the competition this year,&rdquo; says Tomislav Ravic, Team Lead for the Entelect Challenge.<br /><br />&ldquo;Competing successfully in the Challenge is not about the best or cleanest code,&rdquo; says Ravic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the player strategies.

As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.\n  \n There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in June, known as Early Bird Showdown and the second in July, called Modern Worm-fare, with the third one taking place in September, called Worm-ageddon. At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.\n  \n The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, for instance, the ability to introduce new weapons or cloaking devices. Thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.\n  \n This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the second time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!\n  \n As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.\n  \n &ldquo;What a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.&rdquo;\n  \n Prize money for this years&rsquo; event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place and third place will be awarded R25 000.\n  \n Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. &ldquo;We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,&rdquo; says Hurbans.\n  \n Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different. Machine learning is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed by focusing on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. By comparison, AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.\n  \n While AI is seeing an exciting growth, Machine Learning is all around us and changing the way we live and work. There is no doubt that jobs of the future will rely on Machine Learning to a greater or lesser extent.\n  \n The Entelect challenge shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as something that only super coding geeks can enter. This competition is designed for anyone with a basic level of programming who is interested in the world of machine learning and the future of software.\n  \n This year we expect a wide variety of people from different backgrounds to enter which is going to make the player strategies really exciting.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Overdrive, this years&rsquo; Entelect Challenge (https://challenge.entelect.co.za/) launches today. The event will run from the 19th of March, and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa (@AfricaComicCon) on the 26th September at 11am on the center stage. This year it is again being held at the Gallagher Convention Centre.\n  \n &ldquo;Each year we look to build the Challenge around a popular game theme, and this year is &ldquo;Overdrive,&rdquo; says Bianca McFadyen, Marketing Manager, Entelect. &ldquo;The idea behind the theme is not just to make it appealing to those of us who love gaming, but to also provide a game with simple enough rules that anyone with a basic understanding of programming can enter.&rdquo;\n  \n This year, we will be running with a mini-playoffs series, a staggered strategy component.\n  \n The mini-playoffs series will provide more opportunities for contestants to win. As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.\n  \n There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in May, known as Box Carting and the second in June, called The Furious and the Fast 42, with the third one taking place in August, called Vrrrpa! Wanna dice chaana? At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.\n  \n The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.\n  \n This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the third time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!\n  \n As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.\n  \n &ldquo;What a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.&rdquo;\n  \n Prize money for this years&rsquo; event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place, third and fourth place will be awarded R25 000 and 5th place is R10 000.\n  \n Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. &ldquo;We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,&rdquo; says McFadyen.\n  \n Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different. Machine learning is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed by focusing on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. By comparison, AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.\n  \n While AI is seeing an exciting growth, Machine Learning is all around us and changing the way we live and work. There is no doubt that jobs of the future will rely on Machine Learning to a greater or lesser extent.\n  \n The Entelect challenge shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as something that only super coding geeks can enter. This competition is designed for anyone with a basic level of programming who is interested in the world of machine learning and the future of software.\n  \n This year we expect a wide variety of people from different backgrounds to enter which is going to make the player strategies really exciting. Who could win is anyone&rsquo;s guess?\n  \n https://challenge.entelect.co.za/\n https://forum.entelect.co.za/c/entelect-challenge-2020\n https://culture.entelect.co.za/&quot;}">Overdrive, this years&rsquo; Entelect Challenge (https://challenge.entelect.co.za/) launches today.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Graduate applications are open for 2021\n After a challenging two months, our current 64 graduates made it through Entelect&rsquo;s 2020 Boot Camp.

If you are interested in joining Entelect&rsquo;s 2021 Graduate Programme and being part of our Boot Camp visit https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now\n What happens before our Boot Camp kicks off?\nThe most anticipated initiative of the Entelect Graduate Programme are the highly successful open days for upcoming university graduates, held at our offices in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg and Century City, Cape Town. Our Open Days are by invite only and are open to graduates we have either met and communicated with at Career Days, or who have reached out to us, by applying for graduate roles via https://culture.entelect.co.za/position/graduate/ and who have met our minimum requirements. The main objective of our Open Days is for students to gain a better understanding of the software industry, our company and to get better insights and advice on how to enter the job market. The Entelect leadership and management teams attend every Open Day and students get a chance to meet and ask questions from our CEO, Delivery Managers, Account Managers, Solution Architects and previous graduates.\n\nBecause of the overwhelming response from students all over the country to attend these Open Days, this year, we have taken the stance of having these days more often and we hope to kick off the first remote Open Day soon. Our graduate intake for 2021 promises to be very strong and due to our Vacation Work Programme we have already offered several graduates roles for next year.\n \nWhat is the Entelect Graduate Boot Camp programme?\nEach year, we appoint some of the top BSc Computer Science, Engineering and BCom Information Systems graduates from all mainstream universities around the country for our graduate Boot Camp. These graduates start out as full-time Entelect employees, but first complete two months of training and upskilling during our Boot Camp. After completing the Boot Camp programme, the graduates get to work on client or internal projects under the mentorship of our team and technical leads.\n Our clients benefit as they get to work with the country&rsquo;s top graduates who have escalated their technical careers through the programme, while our seniors also benefit personally from helping or people in the specialist areas that they are most passionate about.\n  \n Boot Camp covers both the practical and theoretical side of end-to-end technology solutions. All graduates work through this full syllabus, regardless of which solutions stream they will be working on, giving them a rounded understanding of the full software development lifecycle. By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they will have collaborated to write components of systems in various languages and platforms, all of which would have been vetted and code-reviewed by various technical leads.\n \nWhy do we run this programme?\nEntelect&rsquo;s client base are among the best blue-chip corporates in South Africa. Their appetite for the development of big bespoke systems that differentiate them in the marketplace keeps climbing, hence the demand for talented software engineers. Our extensive training and mentorship programmes are a real differentiator for Entelectuals. Our culture of continuous learning and growing our people is something that is instilled throughout the company.\n\nThere is still a severe shortage of high-end software engineering skills in South Africa. This is why we believe investing in quality software engineering training programmes is a global priority.\n \nWhen building software, engineers need to consider issues such as maintainability, quality, stability, performance, consistent standards, security, and scalability. To build a perfect solution requires the engineer to do all these things in parallel, which is true craftsmanship and takes years of experience. It requires significant thought to be applied to the architecture and design, the ability to apply computer science principles and a strong problem-solving ability. As such, mastering the skills required to deliver great software is a highly adapted talent.\n\nThe Entelect Graduate Boot Camp Programme was created to help build great software engineers, who can solve the toughest problems, deliver quality software using best practises, and who are supported by our other 650 top engineers all over the world.\n\n\n Apply Now&quot;}">Graduate applications are open for 2021<br />After a challenging two months, our current 64 graduates made it through Entelect&rsquo;s 2020 Boot Camp.

<td data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;This year, due to social distancing requirements, we took our annual internal technology conference online! Every Entelect office across the globe joined in to have some fun while learning from their fellow peers.\n \nWe kept the traditional elements alive by having a milkshake competition at intermission, our usual Twitter competitions ran throughout the day, and we held a &lsquo;Suit Up&rsquo; challenge for the best dressed Entelectual on the day.\n \nBut the best surprise of all, which we had kept secret, was the announcement of our international guest speaker, Scott Hanselman. Scott needed no introduction for those in the world of tech.\n \nScott is a web developer who has been blogging for over a decade.
