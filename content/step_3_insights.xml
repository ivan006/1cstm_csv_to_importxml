            <title>Entelect and POWERX unlocking potential within South Africa's renewable energy market</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PowerExThumbnailR.PNG" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect recently completed a digitization project to enable one of South Africa's most interesting and pioneering companies to scale their operations. Here is the story behind our partnership with POWERX, creating a software platform to drive and automate processes as the business prepared to capitalize on a freshly-proven business model.<br /> <br /> Watch and listen to Lelanie Gouws, an executive within POWERX, discuss and share her perspective on their digital enablement journey supported by Entelect. Unlocking their team and their businesses potential within South Africa's growing renewable energy sector.</p> <p> </p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftBWpbjpOUk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p> </p> <p>POWERX is a forward-thinking and innovative company, and the sole licensed entity in South Africa, other than Eskom, that is able to trade renewable electricity between generators and consumers using the National Grid network. POWERX is a pioneer in this area, purchasing clean and green power from generators and selling it on to end users within South Africa.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/NewsPicR.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p>A powerful business concept which was well executed by the POWERX team had meant a rapidly escalating set of demands on the organisation. The team was inundated both by requests from generators of renewable energy for funding and support, and from customers looking to participate in the green energy economy.<br /> <br /> POWERX realized the need for a bespoke management system to support its business of trading renewable electricity, a unique and complex business model. The solution would need to reach across several business functions internally - including sales, operations and billing - as well as external users.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/NewsPic2.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect partnered with the team at POWERX to conceive, formulate and build the end-to-end platform which supports their core business functions related to sales tracking, supply and demand, allocation and reporting. The new platform is now managing all aspects of the business cycle without over-complicating functions and roles, an important consideration and requirement for their smaller operations team.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/powerX.png" style="width: 473px; height: 125px; float: left;" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>POWERX is growing rapidly throughout South Africa, actively looking for clean energy partners and re-sellers. If you're a municipality, a power generator or a business who wants to know more about how POWERX can help you - find them at http://www.powerx.energy/powerx-get-in-touch</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

</o:shapelayout></xml><![endif]--> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> South Africa desperately needs to encourage entrepreneurship as a means to addressing the country’s job creation targets. A report issued by FNB and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) states that “the most competitive nations are those that have the highest level of entrepreneurial activity.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> The Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) is a measurement of the percentage of the active population in a country (people aged between 25 and 64) who are entrepreneurs. According to <a href="http://www.internationalentrepreneurship.com/">International Entrepreneurship</a>, South Africa’s TEA in 2010 is 8.9%. This is higher than in previous years and significantly higher than our average TEA over the past decade: 6.7%. If South Africa wants to be a meaningful player in the global economy, we have to shape education, society and legislation to encourage, rather than stifle, entrepreneurship.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> Marc Benioff, the chairman and CEO of salesforce.com says “Cloud computing has already spawned a significant number of new companies… In the coming decade, thanks to the proliferation of cloud services, ubiquitous, low-cost bandwidth, and cheaper access devices like smartphones, tablets, and netbooks, there are fewer obstacles than ever to turn an idea into a business.”</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) represents a great opportunity for South African entrepreneurs. The much lower barriers to entry and simplicity of launching cloud-based services open up international markets to local businesses. This allows local businesses to generate revenue flows into the country.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> Analyst firm IDC expects the worldwide SaaS market to reach more than US$40 billion by 2014, while ABI Research expects the global market for hosted services to reach US$34 billion in 2012. This trend is reflected in the South African market where interest in SaaS is growing rapidly.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> Cloud services offer reliability, almost effortless scalability and substantial cost savings. However, South African hosting is not a competitive option. The largest local players are, quite simply, charging too much for services that can easily be sourced overseas at a much lower cost.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> How much lower?</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> While the base fees charged for cloud hosting may be comparable, the real test of a service provider’s offering is the data transfer costs on offer. Currently, data traffic for South African hosting options costs between R15 and R85 per GB (some charge more), depending on the level of service required. Foreign cloud service providers charge as little as R1 per GB (depending on the exchange rate) for data transfer.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> South African service providers simply can’t compete with the cloud offerings of Rackspace, Microsoft Azure or Amazon EC2. It’s a question of scale. Foreign cloud service providers can afford to build a much larger server farm because they have a potential pool of hundreds of thousands of customers. Because they have a much larger customer base, they can also charge each customer less. Local cloud service providers are forced to charge more because they have a smaller pool of potential customers, and are dependent on bandwidth providers that charge exorbitant prices.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> In our experience, the argument that local hosting is far quicker than foreign hosting does not hold water. As long as the foreign hosting site is chosen to capitalise on the new undersea cables, the average user will not notice any slow-down in service for software hosted on foreign servers.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> The Protection of Personal Information Bill (PPI) is another potential spanner in the works. The PPI Bill is intended to offer South Africans protection of their personal information, and places the onus on companies collecting such information to ensure that that information is collected with consent, and is stored and used in a secure and responsible manner.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> The PPI bill places stringent requirements on personal information that is sent outside of South Africa. If an entrepreneur chooses to use foreign hosting he has to ensure that:</p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-left:38.25pt;mso-add-space: auto;text-indent:-18.0pt;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">1.<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">       </span></span></span>The country the data will be stored in is subject to similar legislature as the PPI Bill in South Africa,</p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:38.25pt;mso-add-space: auto;text-indent:-18.0pt;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">2.<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">       </span></span></span>He has explicit consent from each of his customers to store their information outside of South Africa, and</p> <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-left:38.25pt;mso-add-space: auto;text-indent:-18.0pt;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">3.<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">       </span></span></span>The transfer of personal information is only done when it is necessary for him to deliver on the contract he has with his customer and is for the benefit of the customer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> South African entrepreneurs should be able to focus on creating Value Added Services. Legislation such as the PPI Bill could force entrepreneurs to choose a far more expensive cloud service provider in order to simplify the contract and reduce risk. This is an unnecessary throttle on our development.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> “The global information economy, including cloud computing, works best when information flows freely across borders in a responsible way with appropriate privacy and security protections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Efforts to lock data within a particular country or region will not only undermine the benefits of the global information economy, but also disadvantage local enterprises that want to take advantage of the tremendous cost, productivity, and innovation advantages that cloud computing enables,” says Benioff.</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> A South African entrepreneur who offers SaaS using cheaper, more reliable offshore hosting will be able to offer products at a lower cost. New businesses will be able to sell more products to more people and, in turn, will be able to grow his business more effectively. While I don’t advocate for irresponsible use of personal data, I do feel that we need a legislative environment that is sensitive to the globalisation of IT that is taking place, and takes steps to make it easier for South Africans to benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">   </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"> Local cloud service providers face an uphill battle in their attempts to compete with foreign providers. To make matters worse, the PPI Bill is a step closer to protectionism that will shackle us to uneconomic, unreliable, expensive options when there is, literally, a world of possibilities out there for us to choose from.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A report issued by FNB and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) states that “the most competitive nations are those that have the highest level of entrepreneurial activity.” The Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) is a measurement of the percentage of the active population in a country (people aged between 25 and 64) who are entrepreneurs. According to International Entrepreneurship, South Africa’s TEA in 2010 is 8.9%. This is higher than in previous years and significantly higher than our average TEA over the past decade: 6.7%. If South Africa wants to be a meaningful player in the global economy, we have to shape education, society and legislation to encourage, rather than stifle, entrepreneurship.]]></excerpt:encoded>

He outlines the importance of knowing your limitations, listening to others and avoiding being everything to everyone. He emphasizes the importance of following ones heart and pushing this through, but always taking guidance from top management who often see things differently and may have a more sober insight in particular areas. Most importantly he sticks to the motto of hiring the best, and living ones values - something he believes is the key ingredient to Entelect's continued growth and success.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Software skills trending in 2014</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2014 3:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[From an employer’s perspective, to make yourself an attractive hire it is important to have an up-to-date knowledge of trending technologies. The ability to show that you are proactive in your research and awareness, that even though you may not have two years’ experience in a language or toolset but can identify what it is, where it came from, why it exists and how to apply it, shows you have an interest in the subject and a positive attitude.<br /> <br /> <em>TechRepublic</em> Senior Editor, Teena Hammond, together with a panel of industry experts, identifies the most recent general trends in 2014, specifically in the fields of security, big data and cloud-based services. Find the article at: <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/top-it-job-skills-in-2014-big-data-mobile-cloud/" target="_blank">http://www.techrepublic.com/article/top-it-job-skills-in-2014-big-data-mobile-cloud/</a> Entelect has seen a similar trend with software development projects specific to South Africa. The predominant focus in software projects and related services is now moving past the 2013 rapid adoption of cloud-based development towards the necessary maturity in the implementation these services.<br /> <br /> The fast-approaching adolescence stage in the usage of cloud-based services finds companies further developing aspects of security and considerations on specific IT-governance and the impact of specific legislation, such as the PoPI (the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013). The industry is currently also addressing teething problems surrounding big data management, refactoring for better data flow and further facilitating intelligent reporting of big data. Many of the initial implementations overlooked these concepts and are now reacting by redeveloping or refactoring implementations caused by the rush to get onto the cloud.<br /> <br /> Entelect continues to notice the same interest in outward-facing concepts such as UX (User eXperience) and responsive design, and the notable back-end trending of technologies, such as NoSQL data stores, and the implementations of Hadoop, Mongo and Raven. Additional key considerations that Entelect advises individuals and companies to consider include HTML5, CSS3 and other frameworks related to mobile platform development. Mobile technologies and apps remain a strong trend in 2014, these can now be seen as an expectation (or subset) of any project delivery.<br /> <br /> It is important for software engineers to keep the above trends in mind, so in an interview situation, when you are asked what technology interests you, you have an opinion on them. If you are not active in the job market, knowledge of these technologies can only add value to your current position.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark Beets (GM: Business Development)</strong> <br/><br/> The software industry is renowned for moving at breakneck speed – a three-week holiday can see you returning to work and being neck-deep in new terminology, technology and techniques. It has become critical as a software engineer to stay abreast of technological advances, specifically the tools, processes and platforms to which you may be exposed. This will enable you to identify the best tool or framework for a job and it will also help you justify your decisions.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>You can’t ‘outsource’ love</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[‘Of course money helps but physically engaging with love is what it’s all about. If people know they are loved and someone else out there cares for them, they will react more positively – and it involves only a little bit of time and sacrifice,’ says Pritchard. ‘We have witnessed this effect in our Foundation programme, where some of our children and young adults have had significant turnarounds in academic performance – even without teaching them subject matter. We focus on supporting them with life questions, helping them to nurture their unique strengths and of course, getting them excited about what’s out there for them when they leave school. We are very grateful to our staff who give up their personal time to support people in need.’ <br /> <br /> Pritchard goes on to say that the act of offering expertise and physical support has more human impact than offering just money, so even organisations that do not have the budget to assist others, can in fact reach out with great effect. <br /> <br /> Click <a href="http://techgirl.co.za/2014/07/24/you-cannot-outsource-your-love/" target="_blank">here</a> to read the Tech Girl article and <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/SocialResponsibility/GivingBackWithGallerySidebar.aspx">here</a> to find out more about Entelect’s varied foundation programmes.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Sam Wright at Tech Girl recently interviewed Entelect CEO, Dr Charles Pritchard. Pritchard asserts that companies need to take ownership of their own community-support initiatives. Although there is a place for allocating budgets to NGOs that support the poor, he suggests that it is far more effective if company employees also become involved in supporting their beneficiaries.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Matthew Butler (Entelect Software: General Manager)</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have we not learned to detect, protect and mitigate against these types of intrusions? If so, as a customer without technical know-how, how do you trust a software vendor to provide secure and trustworthy systems?<br /> <br /> Entelect Software takes a look at a few angles on this topic:<br /> <br /> <strong>Volume</strong><br /> <br /> With a rough estimate of the total number of active websites online as of March 2015 sitting at 1.2 billion – and the explosive growth seen over the past 5 years - the reason we see so much bad press is surely partly due to the sheer volume of public facing web presences being deployed into the wild.<br /> <br /> Ultimately, the more websites we have, the more exposure there is, and there more news there will be of one or another organisation becoming a victim to web security related incidents. Given this vast web of information available via the internet, this volume also makes it an attractive target. Particularly with almost all developed-world banks having online services, and the spread of social and personal information online, it’s hard not to stumble upon something valuable to somebody.<br /> <br /> <strong>Motive</strong><br /> <br /> A second side to this debate, and often the one which frustrates consumers and organisations when they are the victim: why was I targeted?<br /> <br /> <strong>Access or theft</strong><br /> <br /> In general, we think of security when we have something to protect - our cars, homes, possessions and, in the case of web applications, data. If your web system stores or processes data of value, such as payments, personal information, passwords or anything remotely confidential, then it needs to be protected. This information has value to somebody, so there is a clear motive here.<br /> <br /> It’s forgivable to think that your systems are safe because there is nothing stored within that is of value to anybody else, or where the data is all publicly available anyway. Unfortunately, there are still two remaining motive’s that will take advantage of this thinking – vandalism, and infrastructure.<br /> <br /> <strong>Vandalism</strong><br /> <br /> Vandalism of web sites is an unfortunate reality – where the motive is purely one of challenge, fun or an attempt to embarrass or expose the victim. Vandalism motives can range from inconvenience and petty meddling to full scale sabotage and ransom (seen in political and corporate breaches recently).<br /> <br /> <strong>Infrastructure</strong><br /> <br /> Infrastructure is a more interesting motive. In today’s highly connected networks, there are often many more uses for server hardware than the systems or data hosted within. The most prominent one (when the data isn’t the actual target) is to stage and execute more malicious attacks on other targeted victims. Using ‘botnets’, large numbers of compromised and synchronised servers or computers online, large scale attacks such as are possible<br /> <br /> <strong>Mitigation</strong><br /> <br /> This paints quite a grisly picture, but there are answers to be found. The truth is, like many things in the Information Technology industry, there is a cost/benefit ratio to be considered for the approach to protection.<br /> <br /> Ultimately there’s nothing to be done about the volume of websites and the growth of the industry so there is little to be done to curb statistics that way. Looking at each motive, we can however start to position various possible protections.<br /> <br /> The good news is that on one side of the spectrum is a mix of motive and risk that we can be proactive about. A staggering amount of web-based security breaches are perpetrated via automated tools or bots that are constantly scanning the web for vulnerabilities to exploit. These are, at any point in time, often only a handful of risks.<br /> <br /> Knowledge of these vulnerabilities equips a development team with the critical eye required to identify risks early, and close those gaps long before the system sees production. Since these vulnerabilities change fairly frequently – along with new technologies and tools – running once-off training courses or seminars rarely has lasting effects. It makes more sense to us to bake this awareness into the day to day development processes.<br /> <br /> As a software development company, Entelect takes an integrated and active approach to security, we believe that awareness and visibility of these vulnerabilities throughout development, but especially at the start, are the most effective way to build secure systems. Building security into a web application after it is done, in our experience, is vastly more difficult, and costly, and less effective, than including it in from the ground up.<br /> <br /> A key resource we recommend to this end is the oWASP project. Found at https://www.owasp.org, this organisation is a non-profit with a mission “to make software security visible, so that individuals and organizations worldwide can make informed decisions about true software security risks.” Their yearly ‘top-ten’ projects, in particular, help to identify and indicate the most prevalent security flaws, most of which are very easy to close, or at least provide the knowledge about them so as not to remain ignorant of the risks.<br /> <br /> This is the more scary side of motive, and the one that most frequents the headlines – deliberate breach for theft of data. With the high end of the scale being the banks and financial institutions who are obvious targets for fraud and criminal activity.<br /> <br /> The bad news is that highly organised and targeted attacks are often extremely difficult (read: costly) to detect or prevent. In this situation, if the organisational objective is to feel completely covered from any and all vulnerabilities, the capital and ongoing costs can quickly escalate. These costs are for specialised hardware, regular penetration testing and security audits, software development, and ongoing expert consulting.<br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is clear to us that security as part of Software Development is so important. Luckily, it’s also quite straight forward to achieve thorough coverage. With only a relative minority of systems being deliberately and maliciously attacked, the remainder need to take more care. More care with learning, evaluating and mitigating web vulnerabilities, based on their chosen technologies. Awareness is critical – notably awareness of the current generation vulnerabilities that are being easily exploited through automated attacks. Secondly, remedial action applied early and often during development, to evaluate and close any vulnerabilities through technology or features will go a long way to taking your systems off a malicious user’s radar.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Matthew Butler (Entelect Software: General Manager) <br/><br/> The risks and vulnerabilities associated with having an online presence are nothing new, so why then do we,especially within our South African context, continue to see daily reports of breaches, leaks, data-loss, hacking and defacement of sometimes very high profile web sites?]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>What do South Africans have against ICT?</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 13:11:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[After speaking to various friends, family members and clients about the subject, it seems that very few South Africans consider careers in software development or information and communication technologies (ICT) when leaving school.<br /> <br /> There are a number of reasons for this, but first let’s look at why a career in software should be given some consideration by this country’s youth.<br /> <br /> In 2014, Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For revealed that four of the top ten companies were software or technology-related organisations. In fact, the top two were both software companies. Of course, this isn’t an indicator of the attractiveness of all software companies, but the ‘Google-philosophy’ and Silicon Valley culture is certainly more prevalent in tech companies. On the local front, according to Career Junction’s Index (July 2015), the ICT industry sees the highest job vacancy levels in the country. The demand for people to fill ICT roles is more than double that of the engineering industry, which has the third-highest demand level on the Index.<br /> <br /> In addition, according to <a href="http://buzzsouthafrica.com/career-choice-highest-paid-jobs-in-south-africa-2015/4/">Buzz South Africa</a>, the highest-paying job (on average) in SA in 2015 is that of a software engineer. This particular statistic is difficult to measure and differs from survey to survey, however, simply because of the demand for these skills, software engineers and developers will usually be in the top ten of any salary survey. Finally, in the biggest worldwide developer survey – StackOverflow’s 2015 Developer Survey – around 70 percent of participants said that they were self-taught or trained on the job, indicating new levels of sustained value to employees presented by this field.<br /> <br /> So, if ICT companies are usually good companies to work for, it’s relatively easy to find a job, an expensive and lengthy qualification is often not required and the pay is above average, why don’t South Africans want to follow this path?<br /> <br /> At present, the biggest reason is our backgrounds. A large percentage of this country’s population grew up without computers. However, this is changing – smart device ownership is increasing and hopefully we’ll see future generations take a greater interest in the software element of these devices. To add to this, renewed focus and commitment by public and private sector organisations to work towards improving South Africa’s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) schooling performance is expected to yield positive results, which will also play a large part in making the ICT field more accessible for young people.<br /> <br /> There is also a perceived lack of ‘cool factor’ around the industry. However, software development is one of the few white-collar industries where employees can have the instant gratification of building something from scratch. With software being a part of everything nowadays - from apps on phones and devices, social media, as well as the process which runs a DSTV Explora or the SatNav in a car - software developers’ work is often showcased in the public eye. What could be cooler than that?<br /> <br /> In comparison, the ICT industry is the largest private sector employer in India. India has a population of more than one billion people, and has embraced an industry that barely existed there twenty years ago. This has made the nation one of the most powerful ICT forces globally, and demand for the country’s ICT services has driven significant economic development. African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria are also following suit.<br /> <br /> In South Africa, the ICT market continues to expand, and the need for software professionals is clearly present. However, we currently just don’t have people with the right skills to be able to meet this demand and play on the world ICT stage. If Indian can use this industry to boost their economy, why can’t we, and why don’t we?]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Choosing the right company for you – part two</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 1:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Growth</strong><br /> <br /> When looking at small- and medium-sized companies, it is important to look at their growth (head count and client base) over the last few years, wherever possible. Joining a company that is experiencing an accelerated growth can be very beneficial to your career in the long term. However, on the flip side, a company that is losing customers and shrinking its business may ultimately not have room for you. Look for companies that lead in their industry and that are performing well, acquiring new clients and retaining the business and loyalties of old ones.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reputation of the company and its staff</strong><br /> <br /> Do some research to try to understand the image the company holds in the industry. Working for a company synonymous for quality and delivery will be seen as a positive reflection of your abilities and attitude.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Culture and values</strong><br /> <br /> The company culture and its values are very important to your happiness and growth within the company. Ask about the company culture and the team structure to try and ensure that the ethics, values, team dynamics, management style and atmosphere are in-line with what you would like.<br /> <br /> <strong>Employee turnover</strong><br /> <br /> Because developers, analysts, project managers are in high demand, they often move between companies in search for better career opportunities, so resignations from IT companies or divisions are natural and organic. However, be weary of companies with higher-than-normal employee turnover. Generally, companies with this effect have underlying issues that may not easily be seen. Try ascertaining what the management’s attitude is toward employee development and retention.<br /> <br /> <strong>Management team</strong> <br /> <br /> Management teams and styles vary from company to company. Often, development managers, team leads or project managers are most effective if they have worked their way up from developer or analyst. By doing so, they often have a better understanding of the interests, dynamics and intricacies of all parties and components, as well as the business motives behind the decisions that they make. <br /> <br /> <strong>Finer details</strong> <br /> <br /> If you’ve applied for a role and have an interview, try to get a better understanding of exactly what your day-to-day job will entail. Make sure you know what type of development work you are committing to. Make sure you are acquiring transferable skills. Will you be working on challenging new development or are you going to be confined to maintenance work? <br /> <br /> These are not blanket rules and there are exceptions in every case but hopefully the points raised in these articles have given you a better base to make a decision on your next career move.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Yatish Parshotam (Entelect General Manager: Communications) <br/><br/> There are many factors that need to be considered when looking for that perfect company for you. In part one of this series of articles, the determining factors we looked at included the size, track record and staff development of a company.

            <title>Choosing the right company for you – part one</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 2:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Size of company</strong> <br /> <br /> The size of the company makes a significant difference in terms of roles, responsibilities, career opportunities, working dynamics and so on. There is no right or wrong size but you do need to find what works for you because both larger and smaller companies have their advantages and disadvantages:<br /> <br /> Advantages of a larger company: <ul id="careersList"> <li>Structured career paths</li> <li>Mature HR procedures and policies</li> <li>Financial stability</li> </ul> <br /> Disadvantages of a larger company: <ul id="careersList"> <li>Rigid, bureaucratic and inflexible systems</li> <li>More impersonal</li> <li>Less room for visibility at the top and more layers of management approval required for every decision</li> <li>Positions are clearly defined and developers are often pigeonholed into specific areas of the technology stack and software development life cycle</li> </ul> <br /> Advantages of a smaller company:  <ul id="careersList"> <li>Greater opportunity for visibility by top management</li> <li>Higher chance of becoming involved in all areas of the software development life cycle as well as all layers of the software architecture</li> <li>More flexibility and it is typically easier to get buy-in for and implement change</li> </ul> <br /> Disadvantages of a smaller company:  <ul id="careersList"> <li>Slip-ups and weak performances are more visible by top management</li> <li>May not be financially stable</li> </ul> <br /> <strong>Track record</strong><br /> <br /> If the company primarily focuses on consulting, have a look at its website to see if it has a track record listed. Read through the most recent releases and gauge the type of work and technologies on which the company focusses. See if the type of projects listed are in line with what you envisage yourself doing. Look, too at the technology stack used in these projects. Then ask yourself the following questions to get a measure of the company’s health and suitabliity:  <ul> <li>Is the company making use of the latest technologies and tools?</li> <li>Does the company work across a variety of industries and technologies or does it specialise in certain fields?</li> <li>Is the company doing recurring work for the same clients?</li> <li>Is it growing its client base? </li> </ul> <br /> <strong>Staff development</strong><br /> <br /> Mentorship is an integral part of a developer’s growth. For a developer to accelerate his or her technical growth, he or she must be working with stronger developers. This is critical to laying the foundations of good software practices that will live with a developer throughout his or her career.<br /> <br /> Training is just as important for the accelerated growth of a developer. Do some research and ask around to gain insight into the company’s training policies. The company does not always need to send you to expensive external training sessions – sometimes, self-managed internal training sessions are more beneficial. These sessions are presented by senior representatives of staff and have the advantage of being relevant to the current industry trends. The sessions are usually run throughout the year, which can be far more useful than attending a three-day course once a year.<br /> <br /> In part two of “Choosing the right company for you” I’ll take a closer look other determining factors, including the company’s growth, reputation, culture and values, as well as issues surrounding staff, such as management and staff turnover.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Dis-Intra-rupt: The new age of business and looking inwards</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As consumers, we can all agree that this wave of market-disruption is a good thing. We all stand to benefit from this new model of engaging with traditional services. Right now, you can order a dry-cleaning pickup, schedule a dog grooming for your pooch, before catching an online-ordered taxi to the airport. Sitting in comfort during your journey you can live-trade on the stock market in your favourite shares (Go EasyEquities!). All these can be accomplished within a few minutes, with just a few clicks on your tablet or smartphone.<br /> <br /> People generally have a feeling of enjoyment when realising the benefits of using these disruptive apps, primarily because of the rapid response and instant-gratification that is now available. Services like Uber are commonplace. So much so, ‘Uber’ has become as much a buzzword as ‘disruption’ at conferences (drink!).<br /> <br /> Personally, I had previously never used a traditional metered taxi, besides when travelling in a first-world country where it is perceivably safer (cleaner) and I didn’t have to carry any cash. The implication is clear: that not only are Uber-esque services directing business away from the traditional old-school businesses - disruption now looks to grab the attention of an audience that has never previously been serviced.<br /> <br /> Fundamentally though, there is still an underlying problem with the older, mature businesses trying to disrupt their existing market. Their primary problem is a lack of <strong>speed</strong>. Traditional businesses are bogged down by slow processes, primarily in their procurement departments and within their supply chain management. The proverbial red-tape is preventing the necessary acceleration, movement and momentum that is required to disrupt a market.<br /> <br /> Client-facing disruption is now commonplace, expected and easy. To attain the necessary speed to get onto the wave, I think it’s important for the older businesses to first direct the principles of this disruption movement inwards. Businesses need to challenge the way they operate internally. Starting with revamping their processes around purchasing, supplier management, payroll, HR (including recruitment and staff loyalty programmes) and ending with their actual operations: the day-to-day, business-as-usual, grind.<br /> <br /> Businesses have to first internally disrupt to survive this rapid changing and rapid-response demand from a service-hungry consumer market.<br /> <br /> Entelect are often called in to reinvigorate an operational software-development environment. Our software expertise and years of experience afford us a unique opportunity to help a client embrace these changes. The easiest and quickest win is often the systemization of functions that could (and should) be automated and easier to use:<br />  </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>Are companies still using paper based leave and expense claim forms? Yes.</li> <li>Spreadsheets for sales tracking? Yes.</li> <li>Lengthy tender processes for research and development (R&D) initiatives? Yes</li> </ul> <br /> These are simple examples of operationally draining and costly exercises. These should be completed in a maximum of 3 clicks, in under 2 minutes.<br /> <br /> Although every client is different, I have on numerous occasions experienced a complete disconnect between the older, mature business processes, such as traditional procurement which don’t fit the disruptive millennial & on-demand services model. I acknowledge that the red-tape is important, but not always appropriate for modern disruptive services.<br /> <br /> The up-and-coming workforce (and by extension younger consumer) is looking for something vastly different to the industrial age operating model. The next generation will help you in reinvigorating your business, and to do this it is vitally important to engage with your employees individually, understanding their goals and how best to utilise their strengths within, so it becomes mutually beneficial.Reward these employees immediately. Use your older knowledge to teach that building things right, the first time, is still relevant – but also use it to rebuild your business from the inside. Rebuild it with this generation’s service-expectation model.<br /> <br /> Embracing these new ways of operating a business is not easy. You might ask why fix the toaster that is not broken? The bottom line is that your toaster is grimy and slow and burns your fingers because the eject spring has fallen off! It’s time to embrace the new, but make sure you Dis-Intra-rupt your business first.<br />   <div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94ZgXSuyMiA" style="max-width:560px" width="100%"></iframe></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Mark Beets (Entelect General Manager of Business Development)<br/><br/> Every single conference that I attended in 2015 had at least one speaker talking about disruption. At my last conference, it became a drinking game from the obligatory conference Valpré water bottle. Hear the word “disruption”, drink another sip, sit back and watch the old-school, brick and mortar enterprises try to catch up to a technology wave moving with speed.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Building an effective software environment</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people will agree that any working environment needs to be conducive to staff comfort, happiness and output. To achieve this, there should be the right combination of physical space, tools, processes and people.</p>   <p>Without the starting point of a comfortable physical space and the right tools, the environment is likely to fail, irrespective of developers’ technical ability. To ensure an effective physical space, consider the following:</p>   <ul id="careersList"> <li>A secure 24-hour office with flexi-time managed properly. Employees should be able to work safely when they feel most productive.</li> <li>Freedom to come into the office on weekends, whether for ‘real’ work or for side projects and social get-togethers.</li> </ul>   <p>The physical space needs to compliment the tools and equipment available. Staff need:</p>   <ul id="careersList"> <li>The right equipment for the job – for example, easy access to whiteboards enables the ability to use models or meta-models (models of models) to communicate within a team or with clients.</li> <li>Proximity to other teams, preferably doing technical work. It is great to feel part of a busy and innovative company. </li> </ul>   <p>Once the tangible aspects of the work environment are improved, elements such as the processes and people can be developed. To facilitate effective processes, a company should:</p>   <ul id="careersList"> <li>Minimise micro-management and maximise visibility (to both clients and management) and accountability.</li> <li>Encourage collaboration with all stakeholders, including the more distant ones.</li> <li>Emphasise reward, particularly team reward through exposure, public appreciation and celebrations, and personal rewards by way of pride in achievements and difference made.</li> </ul>   <p>The most important element for an effective software environment is the people within it. For software engineers, working alongside a brilliant team is far more rewarding than having a lazy-boy lounger as a desk chair. To ensure job satisfaction, software companies should empower their staff by:</p>   <ul id="careersList"> <li>Encouraging on-the-job learning. Even in cases where a team and project is small, there are creative ways to build these environments. </li> <li>‘Mass’ of team is critical – a larger team carries more momentum in critical softer aspects such as culture, pride and identity. This is a critical learning at Entelect after ten years of building software solutions in team environments. </li> <li>Developers like to be grouped with like-minded professionals so create an environment that stimulates <ul id="careersList"> <li>Curiosity – engineers are curious and happier when we learn something daily. We need to be in an environment where we can feel a sense of wonder.</li> <li>Learning – we learn from those with whom we work and from informal conversations, conferences, training sessions, code reviews and so on.</li> <li>Support – engineers who know they will have to show their output (and their workings) to another engineer, approach work very differently from those who do not and who do not have the same accountability on the line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>   <p>Software engineers often value growth above all else. That feeling of learning something new, meeting someone new, or experiencing something different on a regular basis is key to our happiness. We also need to feel challenged – a little pressure is a great reason to get up in the morning and achieve. Finally, engineers thrive on exposure. We all share a curiosity for the unknown, and a desire to learn and solve. Exposure keeps people satisfied and productive, thereby creating an effective working environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Matthew Butler (Entelect General Manager: Managed Solutions) <br/><br/> To get the best out of their engineers, many firms create the ‘ideal’ place for staff to work. They install creative spaces, televisions that are tuned to news or live events, and state- of-the-art meeting rooms. Some also offer fantastic perks and rewards. How important are these to creating an effective software environment? Are there other, more important, factors to consider?]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Finding the right offshoring partner</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an organisation looking to use offshore software development companies, the emphasis needs to be on ensuring that there is some cost benefit without sacrificing quality. Some of the major factors in determining quality, centre around competency, track record and communication. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Competency</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>The developers from the offshore organisation should be carefully vetted. It is worth interviewing a selection of developers and managers in person to obtain an understanding of the levels of competency of the developers</li> <li>The offshore company should be able to provide standards and technology guidelines, and must be willing to explain the methodology it uses and how it would adapt it for offshore projects, if necessary. </li> <li>Expertise in multiple software technologies is also important. Often if the company is very specialised in one technology set, it becomes difficult to diversify and use new or different technologies, which may be better suited to the task.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Track record</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>The company’s track record, credentials and references should also be scrutinised in order to understand the level of competency within the organisation.</li> <li>Look for a company that is big enough to do the job yet small enough to offer agility and to make the client important enough to receive prompt attention when it is needed. </li> <li>Your company’s satisfaction should be a priority. A company that specialises in software development services (and not only offers software development as a small part of multiple other services) is also advisable. Many of these organisations do fall into the SME space, so SMEs are definitely a great option with this in mind.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Communication</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>Speak to as many people from the company as possible to gauge how the communication would work. This will help to determine up front how communication between the two parties will function.</li> <li>The technologies that are used to work remotely (whether they are an organisation’s own employees or outsource partners) are more mature than ever. These technologies include communication mechanisms, such as Google Hangouts, Slack and Skype as well as those used in software development – distributed source control and project management tools are also increasingly cloud-based or online. </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>In terms of business trends that lead to outsourcing, there are movements towards more specialised business. Many businesses are focusing on their core and outsourcing non-core or specialist areas. Relying on external expertise and focusing on real value-adding relationships with suppliers, vendors and partners is becoming more commonplace. </p> <p> </p> <p>Outsourcing gives organisations a way to accomplish scale and flexibility in resourcing and costs. And of course, better software is becoming a requirement for most business nowadays so using highly qualified and specialist software development companies to assist in this delivery makes good sense.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Shashi Hansjee (CEO – Entelect) <br/><br/> Offshoring companies’ software development needs is becoming common place, particularly as global communication improves and the disparity in technical ability between Western and other countries narrows.

            <title>Offshoring to South Africa – a beneficial engagement</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several benefits that South Africa can offer over other offshore destinations or to organisations looking to offshore from the United States, Europe and Australia. </p> <p> </p> <p>One of the main benefits is the financial gain. Typically, offshore locations such as South Africa, India and the Philippines have a lower cost of living than the United States, European and Australian markets and therefore, development resources are often cheaper in those countries. Obviously, cost-saving at the expense of quality is not recommended and this is the critical point.</p> <p> </p> <p>Whether an organisation outsources software development to a local provider or an offshore provider, it still has to ensure those with whom it is dealing are capable of the task. Offshoring to a highly competent, professional software development company with a proven track record of delivery, and a team of developers who are highly qualified and experienced is the only way that an organisation can achieve the financial benefit associated with offshoring without sacrificing quality.</p> <p> </p> <p>In most cases, to be successful, the software development process needs to be iterative with high levels of communication, trust and collaboration between a client and the provider. Thus the two major areas of concern when offshoring are communication and trust. </p> <p> </p> <p>Although tools such as Slack, Skype and Google Hangouts have made global communication much easier, there can still be barriers around language and culture that hinder the success of a project. Working across different time zones and perhaps even to different working hours can exacerbate these problems. </p> <p> </p> <p>In terms of trust, if a company can physically see its outsourced development team and can work directly with them, trust is built up quicker and collaboration becomes easier. Obviously, this is more difficult in an offshore model but there are measures an organisation can take to mitigate this and develop trust. These include talking to the development team members regularly and meeting with them in person before the project starts. Starting small is a good tactic – if the software company uses an agile approach, the engagement can be ended relatively quickly if that becomes necessary. Exploring references around how a company’s software teams operate is also critical to building trust.</p> <p> </p> <p>While there are many companies across the world to choose from, there are many advantages to utilising the world-class software developers and software development companies in South Africa. </p> <p> </p> <p>On any project, cost is important and although South Africa’s development resources are generally at a lower cost than others, this cost saving does not result in a lower level of service and output quality. While South African software development may be more expensive than that from India and other parts of Asia, there are a number of factors that still make it a stronger proposition in terms of the ability to deliver quality. </p> <p> </p> <p>The business language in South Africa is English and thus communication problems associated with offshoring software development elsewhere do not apply. While in some countries companies often have to shield their developers from clients because of the language barrier, many South African software companies can have integrated technical and account management teams, where the whole team has strong enough business communications skills to deal with the client personally and obtain project information directly.</p> <p> </p> <p>The South African business culture is also very Westernised in that it is similar to that found in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia. Proof of this lies in companies such as Entelect (www.entelect.co.za) whose offshore customers have all commented on the company’s compatibility with their own work environments and cultures, as well as on the company’s professionalism and ability to deliver complex technical solutions at a relatively low cost.</p> <p> </p> <p>South Africans are resourceful and entrepreneurial, and South African developers generally thrive on solving business problems rather than producing code for the sake of it.  They are usually willing to give input and challenge thinking and do not need detailed instructions to complete simple tasks. Generally, they are capable of communicating, showing initiative and taking responsibility. These are common issues associated with outsourcing to India (the most common offshore software development destination). A quick Google search on the topic indicates that there are some fundamental cultural differences that impede quality of service in Indian offshoring, primarily around developers there not showing initiative as a result of the country’s more hierarchical and instructional culture. A by-product of this is lower attrition rates and better retention of knowledge. </p> <p> </p> <p>South Africa has a relatively central time-zone (GMT+2) and therefore has some, if not most, of the work day overlapping with foreign markets. It also directly shares a working day with Western Europe. This means that communication delays are less impactful. The country also has a solid legal system that respects privacy and intellectual property rights.</p> <p> </p> <p>With all these advantages, one would assume offshoring to South African software development companies is common practice. However, South Africa is not currently seen as the preferred software development destination. This may largely be because people outside of the country do not know that there is a great deal of software engineering talent in South Africa. An assumption is also made that in South Africa, and Africa in general, there is poor ICT infrastructure, which is no longer true.</p> <p> </p> <p>In certain other areas, there is a ‘tech bubble’ that has resulted in a vast number of people flooding the market as software developers and they are not qualified or trained well enough to develop software. Although South Africa does have a small talent pool, this is not necessarily a bad thing. In this case, a small market means high levels of specialisation and dedication to the craft. South African software developers usually have to be very good at what they do, to stay in the market. </p> <p> </p> <p>A large part of why there is a skills shortage in South Africa is down to the country’s history and demographics. However, the number of people enrolling in software-related courses at South African universities is increasing each year. There are also several local private-sector companies that are investing a lot of time, effort and money into further widening this pipeline through bursaries, scholarships and raising awareness around the industry.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are many South African success stories and possibly the most notable example is that of software developer Mark Shuttleworth. Shuttleworth founded Thawte (one of the largest certificate authorities on the Internet) and Ubuntu (an open-source operating system).  Another success story is Amazon Web Services’ Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which a team in South Africa under the leadership of Chris Pinkham and Chris Brown built. Sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest and Netflix all run on this technology. Amazon Web Services Q3 2015 revenue is listed as US$2.1 billion, and Amazon still retains a sizeable development team in South Africa.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lesser-known success stories include WooThemes (a Wordpress toolkit) that turns over millions of dollars in revenue annually and Clicks2Customers, which is a digital marketing organisation based in Cape Town. It boasts Vinny Lingham, who is now CEO of Yola Inc., as its founder.</p> <p> </p> <p>South Africa has also developed a number of technological enhancements over the years, such as the CT/CAT scan, the world’s first digital laser, the full-body X-ray scanner, the speed gun used in sports (including cricket and tennis), APS therapy systems and computerised ticketing – all of which have significant software development components to them.</p> <p> </p> <p>While there may be a reluctance to invest in South Africa, it should certainly not be as a result of a lack of technical ability, communication barriers or cultural differences. The success stories speak volumes in highlighting the immense talent found in the country’s software development companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Software start-ups - succeeding before you start</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting a business based on a software product is no easy task. If you're an entrepreneur with all the passion for the business aspects of your new endeavour and the promise of the millions in profit driving you on, don’t be deterred by the mammoth task that is software development - one of the most important elements of your venture.</p> <p> </p> <p>Almost daily, our team is asked by individuals with grand ideas (ridiculous, novel or brilliant) on how to get started with a software-based business. Not one to pass up an opportunity to uplift the development community (and tech-related start-ups) we’ve put together our top tips for anyone starting up in the software development space.</p> <p> </p> <p>1.    Educate yourself</p> <p>Software development is not a simple process of committing your hard-earned financial investment towards an appropriate software company. It’s a journey of highs and lows that you need to prepare for. Kick the tyres and make sure your implementation vehicle will withstand the rigours of all the upcoming road surfaces.</p> <p>We’ve often received emails from prospective start-ups with a total of four bullet points superficially outlining their dreams for starting the next AirBnB-esque platform, and have been asked how much it will cost? If you’re at this point, turn back and Google how AirBnB funded their start-up: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Airbnb.">AirBnB</a></p> <p> </p> <p>2.    Become familiar with the software development lifecycle.</p> <p>Modern development methodologies are specifically tailored for high collaboration, short sprints of work and continuous delivery. These topics are essential to the successful outcome of your project.  The internet is also full of information and stories of people who have taken on the same mammoth task where some have succeeded, but many more have failed. These lessons are expensive to learn yourself - so read up, understand the common themes of success implementation journeys and become familiar with the ins & outs of each step of the journey. Technically educating yourself willarm you with the right tools and mindset to approach the development phase.</p> <p> </p> <p>3.     Know the costs</p> <p>Funding your project is the next biggest hurdle impeding the development and rollout of any software startup or project. Paying for software development is never cheap. Dedicated software development companies house teams of highly-skilled developers and have to pay salaries and their own overheads. The flip-side to the more-expensive engagement is finding your distant relative’s young coding prodigy who is willing to work for peanuts (or the hottest gaming/graphics card). Beware - you get what you pay for. All too often we hear how these start-ups or projects have failed or require substantial rework (another delay) before launching to market.</p> <p>Don't forget about understanding your post-implementation operational software spend such as hosting fees, development maintenance contracts and business continuity (backup plans) of your product. Establish a comfortable medium, balancing the time-cost-scope factors where you have understood the risks of reducing any one of these points against your appetite for the remaining factors.</p> <p> </p> <p>4.     Alternatively, consider an incubator environment: <a href="http://www.smesouthafrica.co.za/16130/Tech-incubators-in-South-Africa/">Tech Incubators in South Africa</a></p> <p>Software does not magically write itself - you have to get involved in every aspect of the delivery pipeline. Key to this is your involvement in translating the business requirements to the development team and holding them accountable to the delivery timelines. Be prepared to “pull the plug early” and find another development partner. On this note: make sure you receive a full set of working, compile-able source code, at very regular intervals to prevent being held to ransom.</p> <p> </p> <p>And finally,</p> <p>5.    Celebrate your milestone successes</p> <p>Developing software is a creative process that continually iterates around phases of analysis, prototyping and solving the current requirement. Setting your sights on being the next best and hottest app that has the potential to sustain in a bevy of applications is not an easy task, but nowhere near impossible.</p> <p> </p> <p>Good luck!</p> <p style="line-height: normal;"> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Six tips for a perfect outsourced software solution</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unless you’re a specialist in the field, developing the software required to power your latest visionary idea in-house is simply not an option. And so, lacking the time, money and skills required to get the job done, you will probably outsource the development to a specialist, thinking that your problems will be solved. But how can you be sure that you’ll end up with exactly what you want… before you run out of money?!</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are some tips that could help you to be one of those businesses:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. Stay true to your vision</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Your vision sets out the reason that your project is important and defines its successful outcome. It is vital for each and every project to have a single, unified vision to keep it on track and ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction.</p> <p> </p> <p>Remember, projects start out as novel ideas focused on results. But along the way, details tend to cloud the vision as more ideas come up and workarounds are implemented. Your vision is under constant threat of being forgotten as new, shinier paths open up ahead of you.</p> <p> </p> <p>Don’t go there! Your vision must be aggressively guarded and managed as it informs almost all decision making, including requirements, scope and budget. Your vision statement is one of the few things documented right at the start of a project. Be sure to promote and protect it throughout.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Understand the requirements</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Kicking off a project before your requirements are crystal clear is a certain path to disaster when outsourcing software development. As a general rule of thumb there are three critical attributes to consider when setting out the requirements for a software build.</p> <p> </p> <p>• Stability – How well do all parties understand the requirements? Are we all on the same page? Ultimately, this is an indication of how likely it is that requirements will change.</p> <p> </p> <p>• Criticality – Requirements with high criticality are the ones that the overall success of the system hinge on. Without these requirements achieved, the project cannot function. It takes great wisdom to realise not all requirements are critical, to truly pick out the primary elements of what success will mean. Achieving this balance across a set of requirements will lead to strong delivery wherever software is built.</p> <p> </p> <p>• Priority – Note that there is a difference between priority and criticality. Priority really means how important the requirement is to stakeholders. A requirement may not be critical to success, but could still be a stakeholder priority. Again, a balanced grading of priority across requirements will make for a fluid development process as high priority items are treated with respect, and low priority items are useful to be traded off when conflicts occur.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. Track progress smartly</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Software markets and projects often move too quickly for documentation to be kept up to date in a meaningful way. Be sure that the tracking system you choose is able to keep up with the speed of progress on your project. Diagrams and models are often better than reams of text, but both are still open to multiple interpretations.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean documentation is obsolete. When used in the appropriate context it could actually prompt us to be smarter about what we pen down. For example, slower changing information on a wiki can be hugely valuable, and remove key-person dependencies.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. Keep your team small</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>A common misconception is that adding bodies to a team can bring calendar dates forward. Doing this, ironically, actually slows delivery down.</p> <p> </p> <p>Fred Brooks famously stated that “nine women can’t make a baby in one month.” The truth is that while large teams are needed for broad projects where a level of parallelism can be achieved during development, communication is complex – so a larger team actually moves more slowly.</p> <p> </p> <p>There is a careful cost:benefit ratio to be weighed up here, but the point to understand is that great software takes time. We often recommend that a client, instead of approaching a project with mindset of x resources over y months, use y resources over x months. Rarely is a few months’ delay (with no impact to total cost of project) going to dramatically change market reception. In fact, extending the launch actually provides more time to understand, process and polish software, usually resulting in a better end product.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5. Understand the Agile methodology</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Agile is a time-boxed and iterative approach to delivering software that works incrementally from the start instead of trying to deliver everything at once near the end of a project. If you’re not using it, or recommending that your vendor use it, you should be. Scrum has already comfortably proven to be more effective than a traditional all-in, top-down approach.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>6. Be actively involved</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Participate in the process. Outsourcing doesn’t mean simply throwing your requirements over the fence and waiting for delivery. Outsourcing means you’re using another team’s expertise and knowledge, blending it with your own subject-matter understanding and, through this partnership, creating something truly mutually beneficial that perfectly meets the needs of your business.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>At the end of the day, outsourcing should save you money and result in better products. After all, you’re getting a team purpose-fit for expert software development to do it for you. It’s important to bear in mind, however, that outsourcing software development isn’t a fire-and-forget exercise. The businesses that are shaking up our markets with innovative solutions and products are the ones following an interactive, disciplined and participatory approach to building software.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Building High Performing Teams</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today's software development environment, there are many teams that are capable of delivering and producing software. But there are also those who fail to meet the delivery requirements usually due to time or budget restrictions and which could be considered a failure.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are various reasons that contribute to software development failures, recorded through empirical studies or anecdotal evidence. Some of these include poor requirements specification, scope creep, poor management, no user involvement, poor communication, or lack of testing.</p> <p> </p> <p>Given that these are some of the factors that can negatively affect the success of the project, the theory suggests that if a project does not encounter any of the negative factors mentioned above, a project should be a success. </p> <p> </p> <p>Someday in the future, it may be possible that all projects will be a success as we'd probably create an Artificial Intelligence to create software. Happy customers and flawless software, what more could any software engineer ask for?</p> <p> </p> <p>Until that time though, software will be created by us - humans whom we group and cluster into optimized teams in an effort to reach the happy customer and flawless software utopia. </p> <p> </p> <p>Over the course of many years being involved in the various facets of software projects from inception, development and eventual go-live of projects, a key and critical success factor has been the teams on these projects. This has begged the question in my mind: what factors of a team contribute to a project's success? </p> <p> </p> <p>Trying to answer this question led me to an overarching description of such teams - High Performance Teams (HPT). In my experience, a HPT is one with key attributes that contribute to a successful project. In real terms this means a team that presents the following five characteristics: </p> <p> </p> <p>1. Delivers continuously at a steady pace.</p> <p>2. Displays a positive sentiment: They want to come to work, they are eager to make the project a success, they are eager to be part of the team, they have a sense of satisfaction from the work they do and they have a sense of purpose.  </p> <p>3. Eager and willing to contribute to the project and to the people around them.</p> <p>4. Seeks every opportunity to improve their skills; either on a project and/or in their role as a leader, and finding ways to facilitate these opportunities while balancing delivery and making sure timelines are met.</p> <p>5. Realizes the importance of mentorship and that team is only as strong as its weakest member: This creates a strong mentorship environment where the seniors are providing constant and regular feedback to juniors to improve themselves, and seniors in turn gain valuable experience with mentoring, which serves to position them as leaders within the team.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, even with these five attributes in place, there are other operational features that can influence a project's success. </p> <p> </p> <p>Empowerment and Decision-making</p> <p>A team that is afforded the ability to autonomously and pro-actively make decisions on project is key for several reasons.</p> <p> </p> <p>Firstly, a HPT can action items immediately, items which would otherwise require several layers of approval. Typically, this is because they have a much closer view of the project at hand. As such, they are well suited to make key decisions on the project, since they are closest and understand the potential impacts better.</p> <p> </p> <p>When it comes to problem solving, HPT teams define and identify the solution space and work within those boundaries. However, they are also not afraid to clarify or challenge the status quo, and due to their closeness to the project are able to think creatively about how to solve problems. </p> <p> </p> <p>A HPT that is empowered often absorb high levels of responsibility and accountability. They take responsibility for their decisions, can justify their actions and decisions, and are not afraid to accept responsibility when things do not go as planned. Plus, they make sure that everyone accepts accountability for the roles. </p> <p> </p> <p>In my experience, a successful component of this process is to recognize the efforts of the team holistically and/or individually and consistently provide direct feedback. Feedback ensures the team is always on the same page and can help to improve self-confidence within the team as a collaborative unit. </p> <p> </p> <p>Furthermore, external factors such as unforeseen changes in the client team, or budget redactions, can present risks and limitations to the team's delivery. It is important that one member of the team keeps an eye on external factors to ensure that the team are able to continue to apply agile planning principles with relevant and necessary information. </p> <p> </p> <p>There should be only one Head Chef in the Kitchen</p> <p>Having clear leadership within a team is important. In order for the HPT to make decisions with immediacy and based on accurate information of project and external factors, the team member fulfilling this role must consistently practice a number of leadership traits that serve to support the growth of the team:</p> <p>1. Keep the end goal in mind and ensure the team is aware of the direction </p> <p>2. Ensure that roles and responsibilities within the team are well understood </p> <p>3. Continuously work to improve the skills of the team throughout the project </p> <p>4. Presents regular status updates to the team </p> <p>5. Identify and highlight areas for improvement, thereby encouraging growth and skills development </p> <p>6. Provide constructive feedback with clear guidance on the way forward </p> <p>7. Provide team sheltering </p> <p>8. Leverages team diversity and employs the diverse skills and attributes to the benefit your team and its delivery </p> <p> </p> <p>In some instances, multiple leaders on the team can be useful, especially if they are fulfilling different roles. However, if those leaders are pulling the team in different directions, the team suffers and ultimately compromises delivery. Usually one head chef will help keep the HPT aligned and focused on optimum project delivery. </p> <p> </p> <p>When these areas are considered holistically, the end results are tangible and contribute to project success.  Although we will never stop striving to achieve the happy customer and flawless software 'utopia', leadership who can consciously work to develop High Performance Teams, will be able to build a reputation for consistently delivery successful software projects, and differentiate themselves from the many out there who just deliver and produce average software.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Corporate IT: Thoughts on staying relevant and becoming competitive  </title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Silicon Valley and technology hubs around the world have become incredibly good at fast, lean product development. And it makes sense to be lean and quick, given the high volume and low success rates that are features of the tech-startup industry. In contrast, older and more established businesses have their flags firmly planted in long-term expensive technology investments and practices that were relevant in the 1980s. The result can be predictable but slow and expensive progress.</p> <p>The tech-startup eco-system has driven the demand for fast-paced agile and lean software practices across the world in all areas of software engineering, and an incredible amount of innovation in software tooling and technology. The landscape is shifting constantly and so too are approaches to designing and building software systems, organizing teams, and managing deliveries. Netflix is a great example of this.</p> <p>To further illustrate the point: currently, there are more than 30 different major Javascript frameworks for web development, multiple cross-platform mobile frameworks which leverage different programming languages to build mobile applications, and of course their native counterparts.</p> <p>Outside of digital, we have an increasing number of languages available on the CLR and JVM for enterprise system development and growing popularity of alternative languages like Scala and Python. It’s starting to make less and less sense to categorize our skills according to the classic platforms of Java and C#.</p> <p>As members of the corporate IT community, what does this mean for us moving forward? How do we make sure we’re delivering against industry’s best practices and leveraging the benefits of modern tools to stay competitive in our industry?</p> <p> </p> <p>1. A culture of ‘continuous improvement’</p> <p>We are on the steepest part of the technological innovation curve in human history. Change is more frequent, rapid and pervasive in our lives than ever before. According to a recent Deloitte university press report, the unit cost of computing-power between 1992 and 2012 came down by a factor of 3700. What cost R3000 then, costs 81c now (<a href="https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/industry/technology/from-exponential-technologies-to-exponential-innovation.html">Deloitte, 2012</a>). More importantly, they found that labour productivity growth flat lined while advances in core digital technologies sky-rocketed: exposing a clear innovation gap. Conclusion? We are not capitalizing on this innovation in software organisations. It’s understandable. We’d like to avoid becoming victims of the latest flavour of the month practice or technology, and we need to manage our risk responsibly. We also don’t want a tendency toward risk-aversion to limit our potential as an organisation.</p> <p>Change is not something that comes easily to us in IT. We are by default attracted to certainty and predictability in most areas of our lives. Who can blame us, there is enormous complexity in what we do and as a result, a huge intellectual and emotional investment in ‘getting it right’ once, let alone again and again. The data is clear though: change in approach, change in technology and change in people are all connected to our future success because change ensures we can constantly remain relevant and can meet our customers needs. While the tech industry has been somewhat successful at adopting agile approaches to manage our software delivery, we have yet to capitalize on being ‘pro-change’ at an organisational level. Because change is expensive and change is intimidating. But when change is integrated into your business model, it can become a fluid part of your process, and consequently, much more cost-sensitive. LinkedIn is a great example of a company that believes wholeheartedly in continual learning.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are some headlines to think about, however each of these points is, in isolation, simultaneosly a brave and sizeable undertaking and a complete necessity.</p> <p>• Foster a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration as a means to continuous learning growth (<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/to-stay-relevant-your-company-and-employees-must-keep-learning">Harvard Business Review</a>)</p> <p>• Leverage popular agile practices to guide your software development process (<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/an-operating-model-for-company-wide-agile-development">McKinsey</a>) </p> <p>• Break down monolithic architectures and functional team barriers in the organisation</p> <p>• Adopt a DevOps approach to reduce operational bottlenecks and speed up the shipping process</p> <p>• Close the gap between business and IT and promote a culture of involvement from business partners (<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/an-operating-model-for-company-wide-agile-development">McKinsey</a>)</p> <p>• Engineer your solutions for change by leveraging modern architectural practices like microservices and containerisation</p> <p> </p> <p>2. Update the way you evaluate and seek talent</p> <p>If you’re an organisation that values deep experience in specific technologies, then you suffer from the disadvantage of having people who are good at the past and (potentially) bad at the future. Adopt a priority of looking for ability, attitude and aptitude for change. Seek these traits out at the cost of all others, and you’ll build teams who are constantly delivering work that is fresh and current.</p> <p>Accept that on-the-job training for any technology, tool and environment is part and parcel of your operational costs. Plan for it, embrace it and get really good at making it happen quickly. If we can build organisations that are resilient to high churn and operate efficiently despite it, we stand a greater chance at succeeding in the current climate. There are modern approaches designed to tackle this:</p> <p>• Lean and fast recruitment processes – invest in shorter, less cumbersome and frictional interview processes.</p> <p>• Smooth onboarding and orientation can help ramp up productivity and employee engagement (<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/technology-can-save-onboarding-from-itself">Harvard Business Review</a>)</p> <p>•  Align with popular tools and technologies to access wider skill-pool, instead of niche products and technologies.</p> <p>• Reduce setup time with pre-configured out-of-the-box development environments and tools</p> <p>• Remuneration strategies that target shorter tenures – reward performance bravely and take into account market movements.</p> <p>• Leverage software development partners for project-based, team-based or staff-augmentation work.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>3. Start at the beginning: Adopt a low-hanging fruit approach</p> <p>Delivering solutions that meet your customers needs perfectly is at the heart of being competitive. Try out a feature-team approach on your next deliverable. Well-designed systems should allow you to ring-fence components and experiment with new technology in a way that lowers the risk of impact on the rest of your eco-system but allows you to make subtle changes to a client solution that keeps you ahead of your competitors. Start with the least critical systems and get comfortable, working your way deeper as you go. Start the conversations in your team and challenge your team to think outside of the box: what should we be doing differently?</p> <p>Trust your team, but contribute to the decision making process. Software engineers don’t need to be architects or have 15 years of experience to bring good ideas to the table, you may find the best ideas coming from the graduate who joined your team 3 months ago. Encourage a culture of joint-accountability and continual learning and innovation - you’ll find that change starts happening seamlessly and without prompt.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>4. Structure that enable quick and collaborative decision-making</p> <p>Finally, bringing your entire team along for the journey is a non-negotiable. Change requires teams to be able to move quickly. Decentralize technical decision-making and invest in making technology and practice decisions as a team. If you can’t build understanding and consensus in your teams due to structures that exist – break them down and start again. High performing teams don’t necessarily need complete autonomy, but they do need trust and cohesion which are two things the old-guard has a poor track-record at fostering.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>As you build confidence in your new approaches, tools and technologies, you’ll build an organisation who are not only resilient to change but thrive in it.  A philosophy of continuous improvement will help you consistently deliver against industry best practices. As a result, staying compeititve will be the very nature of your business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Building High Performance Teams: Part 2 – The 3C’s</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many external factors contribute to the success of software development teams. In a previous article, I discussed some characteristics of high-performance teams (HPTs).</p> <p> </p> <p>These included: </p> <ol> <li>Delivers continuously at a steady pace</li> <li>Displays a positive sentiment</li> <li>Is eager and willing to contribute to the success of the project and to the development of the people around them</li> <li>Values self-improvement and mentorship</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>I also spoke about operational features, such as team empowerment and strong leadership, which contribute to team success.</p> <p> </p> <p>But there are other areas that have a pivotal impact on a team's success. These aspects are indicative traits and behaviors of some team members that eventually begin to rub off on other team members. Not everyone in a team needs to be a 'high flyer' or 'top developer'. Rather, a team should comprise a combination of people who want to learn and people who can teach. </p> <p> </p> <p>The symbiotic nature of such teams leads to mutual benefit for all involved. Less experienced individuals who are eager to learn end up learning more, and improve along the way. The more experienced team members gain satisfaction from seeing those around them improve because of their teaching efforts. The overall team just gets better, works better as a cohesive unit, and delivers successful projects, regularly. </p> <p> </p> <p>Apart from the factors noted above, there are a few other qualities that I believe stand out within high-performing teams. I call these the three C’s: Craftmanship, communication and customer centricity.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Craftsmanship</strong></p> <p>Software craftsmanship is an aspect in software development where coding skill is viewed as an alternative metaphor to engineering or science. It’s the continuous effort to create a working prototype or a system and to iterate and make slight improvements to it over time. It’s a very involved process that sees the craftsmen (i.e. the developers) invest heavily into what is being created. This includes copious amounts of energy, sheer will, determination and, above all, passion. It’s not only about the actual code that is being written but also other aspects that are necessary to ensure the success of that code.</p> <p> </p> <p>These include:</p> <ol> <li>Understanding the domain better</li> <li>Improvement and establishing automated deployment processes</li> <li>Using the correct tool/language/library for the task at hand</li> <li>Engaging in tasks that improve the coding process</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>Software craftsmen are not afraid of feedback and actively seek out ways to improve themselves. They care about the result and  is delivered to the customer.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Communication</strong></p> <p>In any team-based environment, and in life, communication is a primary tool that we all need to interact with others and exchange information. This seems like common sense but it’s often overlooked and not held in high regard in some team-based environments.</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Communication.png" style="width: 701px; height: 526px;" /></p> <p>The above cartoon is typically used to describe common misunderstandings in a software project. It's quite poignant in that it shows how bad communication can lead to mismatched expectations at various levels of delivery. It also shows that communication gaps can occur within a single team, between teams and with the client (and other people).</p> <p> </p> <p>To be fair, communication is difficult, especially when dealing with different people, across various skillsets, with different biases, different cultural backgrounds, varied levels of experience, and each with their own motives and objectives, languages, etc. This excludes the differences you may find when dealing with your customer!</p> <p> </p> <p>Successful teams consider the above factors and build mutual respect. They work together towards a common goal but also all understand what the game is first. It involves upskilling people where required. Understanding and developing respect for your peers, is a group effort that everyone contributes to.</p> <p> </p> <p>Externally though, when dealing with a customer, there is a tendency to over-communicate. I don't believe that over-communication has ever led to project failure. Over-communication should not be haphazard. There is planning and organisation and involves everyone in the team. Communication channels are established upfront, whether it is email, instant messaging or a spreadsheet. The point is that all parties involved agree on the channels of communication. Lastly, key contact people are defined as well the roles of everybody involved.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Customer Centricity</strong></p> <p>Typically, most developers create software for a paying customer: someone who is willing to commission the creation of a system or solution that will solve some business-related problem or give the customer a competitive edge. As developers, we need to keep that in mind as this plays an important part in the decisions we make and the impact of those decisions.</p> <p> </p> <p>Firstly, customers should always get what they paid for. However, in most cases, what customers think they want and what they need can be two different things entirely. A critical part of a developer’s role is to always try and create what the customer needs. This means that we must interact and communicate with them regularly.</p> <p> </p> <p>Customers want working software that meets their needs. They have little consideration for how it was created. Developers want to create working software that makes a difference in someone's life. There is a clear relationship between the motives of the parties involved and this can be leveraged to enhance the product delivered to a customer. Simply put, if a developer can truly understand the customer, their needs and their expectations, a developer is better positioned to create software that has a higher probability of being used and making a difference.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Mileage may vary for different teams, but there is a strong sense that craftsmanship, communication and customer centricity are basic ingredients for high-performance teams. Add some freedom, a bit of authority and autonomy and you’ll have a great team in the making.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why Agile in corporates doesn't work, yet.</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consider the prevalence of technology in our lives and businesses today. Eventually, every business will be a technology business. The proliferation of technology has moved software out of being just a business support function, to one that can define a business’s capability. This makes high-quality software pivotal to a business’s success and means that every corporate in South Africa requires a significant software development workforce to remain relevant in today’s market.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Shift to Agile</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>All CIOs are aware that quality software requires an organisation to follow an Agile development methodology. As a result, all IT divisions in the progressive corporates are fully committed to adopting Agile and are at various levels on their journeys. However, the fundamental issue with implementing Agile in a corporate is the necessity for full buy-in from the entire organisation. It is an organisational shift.</p> <p> </p> <p>Corporate strategy evangelists promote the concept of ‘alignment’: how well an organisation is coordinated to achieve its goals. A central feature of any business strategy is the ability to effectively execute the core of the business while being able to adapt to trends and changes in the market.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Fit for purpose</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Organisational alignment pulls together business strategies, organisational capabilities, resources and management systems – all of which need to be arranged to support the enterprise’s purpose. It is not possible for the organisation to move quickly if it is not aligned and does not demonstrate ‘fitness’ - the capacity to change to fit new circumstances quickly, and thereby remain competitive.</p> <p> </p> <p>Similarly, an Agile methodology advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and rapid and flexible response to change. This is achieved through a culture of intellectual curiosity, collaboration, effective communication and always being ready to challenge the status quo. Importantly, it allows and requires teams to break from old habits before they become counterproductive.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Agile not just about software</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Most business units embrace the flexibility that an Agile approach allows. However, the typical approach is to expose systems teams to barrages of training sessions to upskill those who present an obvious or immediate need. But what is often overlooked is that Agile development requires a culture shift across the entire organisation and the skills need to be applied more broadly than just the central software team.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately, the standard modus operandi across most corporates today is that a business unit innovates a product in isolation, making commitments about delivery timelines with minimal systems input and then finally pushing the team for an unrealistic deadline.</p> <p> </p> <p>This scenario plays out to different extents in various organisations. However, the result often is that it sustains any business siloes that may exist, deadlines are missed, or there is a mass exodus of developers at the end of the project, leaving the sentiment that Agile is bad.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Buy-in is key to success</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Admittedly, much progress has been achieved across various organisations but the key point is that both systems and business teams need to be realistic about how delivery is managed and come up with a process that works in a corporate. Only when everyone - from the individual who first comes up with a product idea to the systems team - buys into changing the way they approach software development, will an organisation benefit from Agile development.</p> <p> </p> <p>Often, ‘pure’ Agile is not feasible in a corporate because expectations across senior management and exec level are always tied to budgets and defined deliverables, something that Agile struggles to represent. But communication - and the ability to communicate your project in a language that various business teams understand – is crucial to creating buy-in. Development managers typically have a spreadsheet that converts story points to hours so that they can report in a way the CFO appreciates, which helps.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Be agile about Agile</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Therefore, Agile in various forms can work in a corporate, but one needs to be agile around implementing Agile. In the specific case of software’s Agile methodology, often it is the organisational capability and resource architecture and management systems that prevent the organisation from being able to fully adopt and gain the full benefit of an Agile approach to software development.</p> <p> </p> <p>An organisation that can transform to a truly Agile culture will recognise it needs to be complemented by strong and sound operational processes throughout all functional areas of the business. CIOs need to understand the importance Agile has on the greater operations of their business and why it can be a game-changer if the organisation can get it right.</p> <p> </p> <p>Consider your business tomorrow. What is your organisation’s capability; do you have the resources to adapt to a shift in direction, tomorrow? If not, then you probably don’t have a fully Agile culture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Custom software development vs off-the-shelf products, which will help elevate your business ahead of its competitors?</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>The choice between custom software development versus an off-the-shelf product is an ongoing debate for start-up's, SMME's, and big corporates.</p> <p> </p> <p>The conversation heats up when scaling comes into the frame and scope requirements become broader. Add to that an increasing user base, the ability to innovate, the need to adapt business offerings as the company grows, then the decision becomes even more complex. </p> <p> </p> <p>Look at successful businesses. Firstly, what distinguish whether the business is successful? Is it one with an innovative and agile approach, or one with revolutionary products? What is the driving force behind this? Perhaps the software they use?</p> <p> </p> <p>Customers have no knowledge on how a company’s software operates, or if it is an off-the-shelf or custom development solution. The important thing is that the user experience is great, and the solution meets your needs and requirements as a business. </p> <p> </p> <p>So how then, does a business decide whether they should be investing in a customized software solution or an off-the-shelf product?</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5 factors to consider when deciding if a bespoke solution is right for you:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>1. Determine an accurate comparison for the cost. You need to look beyond the purchase price, but the whole-life costs (WLC).</p> <p>                </p> <p>2. Some benefits, such as competitive advantage, are worth spending the time to get right. Although time to market is important, the pace of change determined by the market may mean you need to change and redirect your software development needs. Bespoke software takes longer to develop and structure than off-the-shelf products, but it aligns to your business needs. Designing the software correctly, enables agility and quicker turn-around time as the software grows and evolves.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Bespoke seems riskier. While a solution built for 1000’s of companies apparently presents less risk in terms of the functionality, the risk presents itself in application. Each company will use the package differently. Therefore, how relevant it is for your business will determine the risk in the long-run, especially if the pre-determined features cannot adapt to your business needs.</p> <p> </p> <p>4. There are so many software products out there, why go custom? Software products built for the masses are done so with the intent to spend the minimum development cost on changes needed. If the product covers 85% of the business needs out there it's good enough to be used in the market. 85% is the basic features that keep your business running. But, this means you’re competing with the same tools. The innovation required that elevates you ahead of your competitors will be a custom build.</p> <p> </p> <p>5. The resources that a bespoke developer can spend on meeting my objectives are orders of magnitude lower than off-the-shelf products.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have analyzed each question, and are still not sure why bespoke software is better for your business, then you need to consider some aspects that may affect the future of your business more closely.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5 reasons customized solutions will help you to future-proof your organization:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>1. With customized solutions, you only pay for what you need. Whereas, off-the-shelf software solutions cater for various needs of many businesses, meaning there are features and functions that you will never use.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. Using a tailored solution means you can satisfy your own business model, rather than that of a product. There will be times when you have to adjust features based on your business needs, or as your business grows. This results in you being at the mercy of the vendor to satisfy your needs.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. To meet your current and future business needs, customized solutions enable you to align the software to your own brand and specifically, it’s market positioning.</p> <p> </p> <p>4. Applying a solution that is specific to your processes and people is central to your business structure and growth strategy.</p> <p> </p> <p>5. Customized solutions, for all the reasons above, enable your business to innovate from within and not be dependent on the product to slowly evolve.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the last 5-10 years, much has changed in terms of software packages, open source and custom services that specialize in a single service only. Most of these are free or come at a low price. It integrates well into your software and simplifies the work for you.</p> <p> </p> <p>Take Authentication for example: AuthO is a single sign on & Token based authentication as a service. That means your authentication for your system or application is handled, managed and taken care of. There is no need to build your own. This allows you to focus on your business needs and build out the solution which fits your business.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Which option is right for your needs? </strong></p> <p> </p> <p>You should think carefully about your individual business requirements before making a choice, because you will need software that helps you achieve maximum results in line with your business strategy.</p> <p> </p> <p>Bespoke applications can offer huge commercial and business benefits, giving you a competitive advantage.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you find a professional with best practice standards who can develop the software,</p> <p>and meet your growing business needs by providing regular software updates, then a bespoke solution could be much more cost efficient in the long run.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Trends in Enterprise Software. What we can expect to see in 2018.</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Nico Mulder (Entelect, Delivery Manager)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>This year is likely to be another revolutionary year in the enterprise software space. Underpinned by trends ranging from cognitive technologies to machine learning, we can expect to see businesses shift to building consumer-centric software solutions with an increased focus on user experience. Enterprises have started to recognise they can gain operational advantages from applying consumer offerings internally.</p> <p> </p> <p>Typically, enterprise software development responds to software needs in a B2B environment, but this has constrained thinking for software innovation. While companies use technology trends such as chat bots to improve their external and consumer facing initiatives, they have overlooked the advantages these kinds of approaches can have on their internal operations.</p> <p> </p> <p>As such, much of what we saw in 2017 will continue to progress; Agile development, Mobility and Custom software development. But two core driving forces behind these trends for 2018 will be the renewed focus on user experience within enterprises mimicking consumer offerings.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Why enterprises will start to mimic consumer offerings</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Until recently, CRM software was all pushed to the cloud, simply because it seemed to be the ideal environment for so much data. Companies were so focussed on their operations, they lost sight of the consumer side. But with more millennials coming into the workforce, this is changing. Millennials operate in a world where their entire lives are optimised. They expect this of their employers and working environments too. And importantly, companies have realised that applying more UX thinking to their enterprise solutions will improve operational efficiencies.</p> <p> </p> <p>Enterprise Software used to dictate how the software works and the usability. It wasn’t built for the end-user, but built to service the business and variances of a business process. The employee had to perform a job, and the software enabled them to do so, irrespective of the user experience.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the past, business objectives driving consumer offerings have typically been; to improve customer experience, to optimize the user journey, or to optimise offerings to the customer. But companies are starting to ask the question – what if we apply this thinking to our employees and their operations? Suddenly the objectives become; to improve employee experience, to optimise the employee journey, or to optimise the offerings to the employee. This can all lead to improved internal efficiencies and productivity.</p> <p> </p> <p>Consequently, businesses will start to create internal systems that not only reflect consumer offerings, but also have a high user experience factor, to enable quick adoption and improved productivity.</p> <p> </p> <p>Mobile CRM platforms are a great example of the ways modern enterprise software is starting to mimic consumer offerings for operational advantages. Real-time collaboration on any device is becoming a more important for productivity. Most jobs require teamwork and communication and tools that enable this are going to put businesses at an advantage.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately, while trends like Mobility are on the rise in terms of mimicking consumer offerings, it won’t yet stretch as far as applied use of social media. In fact, social media within enterprise software hasn't taken off as much as one would like. Yes, corporates are improving their social interactions and employee experience within the company, but enterprise software doesn't yet leverage the impact and insights of social media as much as it can.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>So what are the technology trends that are going to underpin this shift for enterprises in 2018?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Agile, Digital Transformation</strong> within the corporate environment. This transformation is rapidly transforming and driving enterprise software towards consumerism. CIO's and CTO's are becoming more closely involved with the design of products and systems, ensuring the build and roll out is done within an Agile environment.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Less offshore development </strong>and more in-house capability and re-use of ‘Software as a Service’ is starting to infiltrate and customize enterprise software.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Custom Software development </strong>for enterprise software. Replacing and moving away from off-the-shelf products, which require a high degree of integration and customization and don’t focus on user experience. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Cognitive technologies</strong> focused on Product, Process, and Insight will have a massive spike in the user experience initiatives which haven’t been adopted yet. Overall, Cognitive Technologies encourage a greater use of the existing services and streamline continuous feedback and information gathering.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Lower infrastructure costs</strong> achieved through more efficient utilization of IT resources, and an increase in capacity to handle peak demands. The use of Containerisation will definitely increase in 2018.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong> will become a mandatory business aspect with the rise of chatbots and business bots automating various features and customer self-service portals. We’ve already seen this in the past years but expect to see the trend continue in 2018.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mobility </strong>will play a big factor in the enterprise software space, as the need to improve UX for employee productivity will be a necessity. Some businesses, in the agricultural and healthcare industries have started making this move, but in 2018, we can expect to see businesses in other industries such as automotive and short-term insurance, which will recognise the advantages of having a mobility solution built-in for their teams.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Needless to say, 2018 will definitely be another groundbreaking year, trying to play catch up with renewed and improved technological companies. Companies wishing to attract the best talent will be seeking to improve their employee experience by mimicking consumer offerings. The extent to which the seven tech trends will impact the move to consumer offerings and UX is yet to be seen, but suffice to say, we can expect them to be key features to some degree or another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Working from home - is there a verdict?</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><strong>By Nico Mulder (Entelect Delivery Manager)</strong></div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>Tele-working and Telecommuting are both popular thanks to technology tools that facilitate communication and collaboration. But it doesn’t necessarily mean both deliver the same results in terms of employee engagement and productivity.<br />  <br /> Telecommuting, also known as remote work, is when work is undertaken at a different location than the head office to reduce the commuting time. Tele-working is a working arrangement where employees do not commute or travel at all.  Although the terms are used interchangeably, they are in fact two very different things.<br /> <br /> Telecommuting was first introduced in the early 1970's, when technology allowed linked satellite offices to connect to downtown mainframes through dumb terminals using telephone lines as a network bridge.</div> <div> <br /> Then, in the 1980's, the continued decrease in hardware costs and increased network speed has allowed employees to use computers to connect to their offices from the convenience of their own home. These days fibre to the home enables high-speed internet to the home, thereby facilitating conference calls, videos calls, and high-speed video streaming, furthering the potential for telecommuting.<br />  <br /> Technology undoubtedly, has enabled working from home possible  as it provides  a platform to deliver fluent communication and collaboration of employees, for example:<br /> • Skype<br /> • WhatsApp - Groups<br /> • Slack<br /> • Email<br /> • Video Conferencing Applications<br />  <br /> <strong>21st century digital work</strong></div> <div> </div> <div>From an employer's perspective, there are several benefits for a company to embrace telecommuting:</div> <div> </div> <div>1.<strong> Real-estate. </strong>A reduction in required desk space, in some instances as much as 40% of a workforce has been known to work remotely. That is nearly 40% of your employee costs.<br /> 2. <strong>Autonomy and freedom.</strong> Giving your employees the freedom to work from their most productive space each day, and to enjoy the benefits of flexible working hours, feeds employee satisfaction and trust.<br /> 3. <strong>Saving travel time.</strong> Employees who need to commute for long hours a day can be more productive if they can save unnecessary travel time.<br />  <br /> There are several varieties of ‘working from home’ structures:</div> <div><br /> 1. <strong>Work from home on a needs basis only:</strong> For instance, when the plumber needs to fix something, you are waiting for a package to be delivered to your house, or when the kids are sick.<br /> 2. <strong>Work from home for 2-3 days of the week:</strong> A hybrid approach like this saves time on travel and commuting, but means the employee is available in the office for the other days of the week.<br /> 3. <strong>Work from home, full-time:</strong> Also known as Tele-working. In this structure, the employee is only required to be in the office for meetings when video calls or conference calls aren’t an option.</div> <div><br /> <strong>Times have changed. Tools for collaboration are in full swing</strong></div> <div><br /> IBM used to be a big supporter of the work from home initiative. In 2009 IBM boasted that 40% of its employee base didn't have an office. IBM, as a consultancy, advised their clients that working from home was a great initiative, and that leading by example was great for marketing. But by 2015 IBM rolled back on their decision to work from home. IBM's revenue had fallen 20 quarters in a row, and although IBM wanted to imitate a Google or Apple, neither Google nor Apple supported working from home to the extent that IBM had implemented.</div> <div> <br /> Similarly, Yahoo reversed it's working from home policy in 2013 after the company had to cut their workforce by 2 000 employees due to financial troubles in 2012.</div> <div> </div> <div>Facebook’s approach was different. It focussed on driving collaboration and social engagement and so, created the world’s largest open-plan offices. While flexibility remains crucial to the modern working style, Facebook recognised that human interaction and engagement was also important in getting things done and for creative thinking.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>It’s still about connecting with people</strong></div> <div> </div> <div>With technology available to make remote work faster, less expensive and more effective, the Facebook example shows that we don't connect with people just by being at your desk, we connect with people by talking to them. So this is where environments like the coffee machine and cafeteria work well. While technology enables virtual collaboration and communication, it is not entirely a replacement for human interaction. There are some things that we, as humans, essentially require to collaborate effectively. We call this collaborative efficiency, and its critical to effective teams.</div> <div> </div> <div>Back in 1977, MIT professor Thomas J. Allen looked at communication patterns among scientists and engineers and found that the farther apart their desks were, the less likely they were to communicate. At the 30-meter mark, the likelihood of regular communication approached zero.<br />  <br /> The automatic expectation has been that technology should improve communication and remove distance. But the study revealed that people use these tools to connect with people they see face-to-face as well.<br />  <br /> Michelle Peluso, IBM, Chief Marketing Officer believes that, "There is something about a team being more powerful, more impactful, more creative, and frankly hopefully having more fun when they shoulder to shoulder."<br />  <br /> In the working environment of today, employees are always working in teams. The lone worker has by in large fallen away. Now-days, employees in most industries, and especially in the software space, prefer to work in Agile team structures that are multi-disciplinary.</div> <div> </div> <div>Creative problem solving, quick delivery, and the application of judgement on complex business situations requires employee interaction and sometimes, this can only be truly effective in an environment designed to support creative collaborative efficiency.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>The intersection between flexible hours and team collaboration</strong></div> <div> </div> <div>Certainly the nature of work has changed. We will never return to a system where people all work a 9-5 day, based at the offce. But with that, companies have recognised the importance of collaboration. We can expect to see companies investing in developing intelligent working spaces that offer productive, collaborative, environments for their employees. Enabling them to jump into quick meetings, quick coffee catch-ups, and host interactive sessions for creative planning, when they are at the office.</div> <div> </div> <div>There is the old saying...two heads are better than one. Collaborating in your teams is vital. There are smaller offices, and spaces where one can experience a quiet focused environment, but also collaborate and interact.</div> <div> </div> <div>Equally, employees shouldn’t see offices only as a place for meetings and companies should look at how they can create creative and collaborative working environments that add value.</div> <div> </div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Choose your digital transformation starting point</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 11:34:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ChoosingyourDigitalTransformationStartingPoint-Moosa.jpg" style="width: 650px; height: 358px;" /></p> <p><br /> by Moosa Gani – Delivery Manager</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Where do you start on your path to Digital Transformation</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>There are many successful Digital Transformation stories out there. According to Gartner, about 66% of leaders want to transform, but only about 11% are actually achieving a healthy dose of digital business. In your quest to Digitally Transform, questions such as “Have we unlocked new digital ways of making money?” or “Can we quantifiably differentiate the way to deliver value to our customers?”. If you answered “No” to either, then your Digital Transformation journey continues.<br /> As with anything new, it is always difficult to get things off the ground, to take that first step. This most certainly applies to Digital Transformation as organisations get stuck on their starting points. According to Gartner, 57% of organisations have yet to find a starting point on their Digital Transformation journey.<br /> Here are 4 points that CIOs can leverage on their journey to Digital Transformation.</p> <p> </p> <ol start="1" type="1"> <li><strong>Connected </strong><br />  </li> </ol> <p>As they say, knowledge is power and as with any form of transformation, lessons learned or data accumulated is always key. How do you know where you’re going if you don't know where you have come from? Connected is not a transformation per se but an exercise in laying the foundations for optimisation and data gathering initiatives.<br /> As you connect all the assets that make up your business, therein lies the value to transform. From creating better efficiencies around delivery times and device utilisation or implementing technologies like IOT (Internet of things) to reduce costs. Once connected, organisations will be able to leverage the connections and data to open up new revenue streams from mining data or just exposing the data across the value chain for better correlations and efficiency.</p> <p> </p> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li><strong>Autonomous </strong><br />  </li> </ol> <p>As we move into a world where machines become ‘smarter’ with the likes of ML and AI, there exists many opportunities. From automating mundane human processes to complex AI scenarios, such as the use of drones for the security industry for facial recognition or perimeter and zone defence systems, the use cases are plentiful.<br /> Just as the machines make human efficiency better it is important to also note the converse. A machine is only as good as what it has been taught to do. With the rise of AI and machine learning, organisations can leverage these forms of autonomous technologies to gain competitive advantages, unlock new revenue streams or just cut costs with better efficiencies. </p> <p> </p> <ol start="3" type="1"> <li><strong>Empowered</strong><br />  </li> </ol> <p>Organisations who empower their clients create exponential growth in terms of value-add. As an example, in the medical field, Apple’s new series 4 watch has the ability to conduct an ECG (Electrocardiogram). This gives the user the pre-emptive ability to be aware of health-related heart conditions before it’s too late. This not only saves lives but also medical costs.<br /> Apple has empowered their consumers through the use of technology, giving them relevant information, thereby empowering them to be proactive instead of reactive.</p> <p> </p> <ol start="4" type="1"> <li><strong>Programmable </strong><br />  </li> </ol> <p>For organisations that choose to go the programmable route as a starting point, it is important to note that business and operating model changes become a focus. The objective is to allow other parties to leverage your assets in order to deliver value to your organisation.<br /> This is generally done by means of API’s (application programming interfaces) that give 3rd parties the ability to unlock value from what you have exposed to them. Examples of this are banks which expose services through API’s like charging for each call for digital identity verifications or bank account verifications. This unlocks new revenue streams and new business models to work with. <br /> There is no simple formula to Digital Transformation. There is only the starting point.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Which one will be yours?</strong><br /> <br />  </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[There are many successful Digital Transformation stories out there. According to Gartner, about 66% of leaders want to transform, but only about 11% are actually achieving a healthy dose of digital business. In your quest to Digitally Transform, questions such as “Have we unlocked new digital ways of making money?” or “Can we quantifiably differentiate the way to deliver value to our customers?”. If you answered “No” to either, then your Digital Transformation journey continues.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Making the most of your 2019 technology budget</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Entelect_2019TechnologyBudget.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p>By Mark Beets, General Manager at Entelect</p> <p> </p> <p>In recent years it has become critical for Medium Enterprises (MEs) to accurately analyse their technology-related spend to rather detail the desired value-generators. This value perspective aids the decision-making process and also ensures the spend is aligned with the desired organisational goals.</p> <p><br /> A beneficial side-effect of this analysis will also re-awaken an appreciation of the balance between projected market-need versus actual business-demand, empowering stakeholders to make better decisions on where to invest that hard-earned cash.</p> <p> </p> <p>An optimally-functioning ME should also look to exploit the inherent organisational adaptability to deliver quantifiable results in shorter time frames, compared to a larger behemoth. Fundamentally, any successful ME CIO’s mandate should be to consider spend-optimisation with 3 primary goals in mind:</p> <p><br /> Advancement, Process Efficiency and Transformation.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Advancement/ Enhancement:</strong><br /> Advancing the business should be high up on the list of CIO priorities: the consideration of Research and Development (R&D) opportunities and the trend to prioritize solutioning over systemization. Sweating the infrastructure assets (where possible), and redirecting the always-shoestring IT budget to identifiable iterative development projects should be a priority. Decisions towards developing solutions that look to evolve the organization's competitive advantage are critical for growing market-share. This short-term strategy should look to produce the largest gains for instant recognition, immediately leverageable by the marketing and sales teams.</p> <p><br /> Medium to long term would be to (thereafter) stabilise these gains for sustainable growth (through systemization).</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Process Efficiency</strong><br /> Identifying and streamlining any system, or people related processes, with an effort to reduce spend and alleviate user frustration is the current trend for a service demanding and app-fickle generation.</p> <p><br /> Push for those cost-controls and cost-reduction initiatives, but continue to show improvements in system efficiencies to continually buy favour in your user base.</p> <p><br /> This is always a tough ask for already sunk costs and ageing equipment - but an easier ask if the sourcing team has already considered feature enhancements while in the original purchasing phase of any organisations systems.</p> <p> </p> <p>Process efficiency is now a top-down approach as business stakeholders have an appetite to consider a short-term offering dynamism, driven by a realisation that the ME needs to differentiate in a saturated market.</p> <p><br /> For custom solutioning, aligning a sourcing (partnership) strategy with the business direction will look to create harmony between technology goals the correct solution partner. Efficiently reducing wasteful redesign or rework with an established and experienced provider that has proven itself in the services market before.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Transformation</strong></p> <p>Solutioning that looks to increase market share (or capture a market), increase profit/returns or increase company revenue, are all top-of-mind for C-Suiters and are a top priority due to the highest value returns.Unfortunately only a few CIOs are considering new technologies and advancements to accomplish this, instead focussing on overall stability to meet these goals.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ME transformation strategy is to change business goals towards faster services & solutioning. The large effort will come with transforming the current business delivery culture into smaller, in-house entities for small, quick solutioning teams for faster gains. These teams can always be absorbed into the legacy business stable, or become the new engine at a later stage.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/EntelectNewsletter1.png" /></p> <p>Source: Gartner, May 2018 [https://www.gartner.com/doc/3877164?ref=clientFriendlyURL]</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>In summary:</strong></p> <p>Your competitor’s faster, collaborative teams are eating away at your market share.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ultimately a pragmatic approach to assign budget spend to the correct value-initiative is always unique to the business and often based on the overall maturity of the organisation. It is, however, becoming more important to rather bias this spend towards business value generators and not necessarily ROI: and to consider this factor (value) as well as: type, size and complexity of each solution, to deliver the most organisational impact.</p> <p> </p> <p>Finding the right talent, using the appropriate systems (at the right price point) and combining these to develop a solution-based culture is fundamental to the success of medium-sized enterprises in 2019.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Reasons to upgrade your legacy systems</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Reasonstoupgradeyourlegacysystems.png" style="width: 800px; height: 418px;" /></p> <p><br /> <strong>Upgrading your legacy systems: A digital advantage or giant waste of money?</strong><br />  </p> <p>For most enterprises, the thought of upgrading a longstanding legacy system is quite daunting. It can be a highly cumbersome process with lots of moving parts to account for, generally leading to an <em>if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it</em> mindset. The process of upgrading is also infamous for often being a costly exercise – causing many business leaders to cling to their deteriorating systems. When a legacy system still meets the current requirements, it’s hard to justify spending resources to stay up to date.<br />  </p> <p>Globally, IT has earned a poor reputation by making headlines for money being wasted on major legacy upgrades, often massively impacting customers due to rushed projects. This is due to a misperception that digitisation has to include scrapping existing technology and starting over. But your upgrade could find a happy medium by adopting a hybrid approach between legacy and modern systems.<br />  </p> <p>Although your ageing digital tools may get the job done, it’s important to recognise when your business has the need for a modernised alternative. Deteriorating legacy systems and processes you currently have in place can only take you so far until they start falling behind. This will impede your business from thriving in the long run.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Four reasons to upgrade your legacy system:</strong><br /> There are many justifications for system upgrades, but your main driving forces to consider are:<br /> <br /> <strong>1.    Upgrades reduce security risks</strong><br /> Legacy software was initially focused on functionality more than security and is often vulnerable to attack from cyber criminals. Underpinning technology stacks could also be nearing end of life and will not see future upgrades. For businesses operating under some of the more recent regulatory compliance requirements such as POPI and GDPR, outdated technologies can lead to repercussions in the form of penalties and reputational damage.<br /> <strong>2.    There is a shrinking talent pool to service legacy systems</strong><br /> The skills needed to support ageing systems are becoming scarce and expensive. There are many of these solutions still in service, but the number IT professionals who can understand and update the code dwindles as the modern workforce moves towards relevant and transferrable technology skillsets.<br /> <strong>3.    Operating and maintaining legacy systems is costly</strong><br /> The cost of legacy technology maintenance, in the form of licensing and expensive specialised hardware, often outweighs the upgrade investment, even over shorter timeframes. The biggest cost risk is of course that of the potential failure of a legacy system and the resulting business losses.<br /> <strong>4.    Innovation is stifled</strong><br /> Older technologies and systems will limit the level of innovation and not able to take advantage of more modern solutions that customers have become accustomed to.<br />  </p> <p><strong>How to navigate an upgrade project</strong><br /> <br /> Before starting your upgrade, consider the following to ensure your business stays up and running:<br /> •    Avoid one massive upgrade, and the “big bang” approach. Rather focus on constantly making smaller innovations and renewing as you go.<br /> •    Do enough research and don’t fall for fancy buzzwords like artificial intelligence or robotic process automation, because the chances are you won’t actually need it. Rather understand what your business truly needs to grow. There are no silver bullets.<br /> •    Ensure any new solutions are designed around compatibility with current systems to create a more seamless transition. Start with a complete audit of your technology landscape to gain a clear picture of potential impact. This ensures that no surprise failures pop up when going live with a new system.<br />  </p> <p>There are many obvious and not-so-obvious reasons for upgrading your legacy system, and it’s better to make a decision to upgrade your system now than to have the decision forced upon you later. But being old doesn’t mean technology doesn’t add value either. Sometimes changes in business processes are more important than technological changes.<br />  </p> <p>Considering whether to upgrade or replace legacy systems is a daunting task for many, but if you do embark on an upgrade, success will come from moving methodically and pragmatically.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>A South African perspective on traditional IT versus digital transformation</title>

            <title>Build and buy: Where custom software belongs in your universe</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 14:33:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/BuildandBuy-Wherecustomsoftwarebelongsinyouruniverse-FINAL-15.png" /></p> <p><br /> As businesses evolve, they will need software as a foundation of their strategy. Whether it’s a product, supporting a service, or driving efficiency in business processes, there is no avoiding it.</p> <p> </p> <p>Historically, custom software has been infamous for being costly and redundant in the presence of an ever-growing variety and quality of packaged software solutions. There are several areas in your overall architecture where packaged solutions still make the most sense. These include systems supporting generic business functions such as payroll, call centre, and systems-of-record. In these areas, the business needs industry-standard and proven systems which are unlikely to require much customisation.</p> <p> </p> <p>In recent times, custom development approaches have proven to be back in favour as a critical component of any holistic IT architecture. The key consideration is where.</p> <p> </p> <p>In a modern enterprise architecture, custom software is essential for innovation, differentiation and integration:</p> <p><br /> <strong>1.    Innovation</strong><br /> You are building customer surface areas or digital channels that need to be truly innovative. This is software that defines your business.</p> <p><br /> <strong>2.    Differentiation</strong><br /> You are currently in a competitive environment with a niche product or service. You need a solution that differentiates yourself from competitors to stand out from the crowd and win customers.</p> <p><br /> <strong>3.    Integration</strong><br /> You have your packaged solutions selected and working well independently, but need to present a more rationalised and streamlined experience to your users. You will need well-designed custom software to achieve this.</p> <p> </p> <p>Interestingly, there is a parallel to be drawn here with how we often approach investment strategies, and consider risk versus reward over the long term. There is a popular portfolio-building strategy called Core & Satellite. The premise is to build a portfolio designed to minimise volatility and cost, while balancing risk between active and passive funds to provide an opportunity to outperform the market as a whole.</p> <p> </p> <p>At the ‘core’ of your investment strategy should be assets that are cost-effective, proven, robust, best-practice, and relatively risk-free. Similarly, you need dependable and functional packaged software as the building blocks of your architecture.</p> <p> </p> <p>At the ‘satellites’ around these building blocks, you need custom solutions in order to innovate and to truly differentiate yourself. You need non-standard and memorable experiences which offer greater impact and reward, but come with some degree of risk.</p> <p> </p> <p>Balanced correctly, both your IT and investment architectures are geared to yield generous returns.</p> <p><br /> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/BuildandBuyINFOGRAPHIC.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>You need the robust and cost-effective, but static and unexciting packaged products. You also need to deploy custom systems and differentiated user experiences to succeed. Ultimately, your ambition should be to build and buy, to create a holistic strategy which correctly exploits both approaches.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The data science behind UX</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 13:13:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/TheDataScienceBehindUX.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>With the technological advancement in the 21st century, everybody wants to experience the best technology with the least amount of effort. By now, user experience (UX) design is recognised as a crucial part of customer satisfaction, but without the relevant data to validate the designs, we’re relying too much on intuition.</p> <p> </p> <p>Design and data are a hard-to-ignore symbiosis. UX Engineers have a variety of research and problem-solving techniques at their disposal, but data is probably the most important. While design instincts are still valuable, data and analytics can help you refine your product understanding and ensure your decisions satisfy stakeholders.</p> <p> </p> <p>Familiarity with users isn’t the same as listening to them. Here is how using targeted, data-driven research can help you listen to the needs of users to create seamless and memorable digital experiences:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1.    Find what truly resonates with users</strong></p> <p><br /> If you’re designing a completely new product, you need user input, However, users are infamously bad at explaining their needs, often asking for the wrong features. Experience and good intuition are assets for UX Engineers, but without robust data, decisions would be based on educated guesses and some fairly intangible principles.</p> <p> </p> <p>This is where data science comes in. Using data-driven insights, UX Engineers will better understand user behaviour and context, categorise users by behavioural patterns, and find direction in the design process.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2.    Focus on the correct problem</strong></p> <p><br /> Being familiar with the product and deeply invested in its success, often affects the objectivity of the UX Engineer. Data-driven UX, provides insights to minimise guesswork, preventing UX Engineers from wasting time by circling back to research steps in the process.</p> <p> </p> <p>It’s not necessarily about the data – but rather about gathering and analysing data properly in order to find the correct problems which will need creative solutions. The lack of data-supported evidence risks designing the wrong services, products and experiences.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.    Explore other approaches</strong></p> <p><br /> Assumptions are always a problem with the creative process of UX design, especially when it comes to relying on gut feeling. It’s hard to shake off usual approaches and best practices to create something that truly resonates with your audience. Data science can help guide UX Engineers in a more creative direction, tailoring the UX specifically to each target audience.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Data may show user misunderstandings, how they take shortcuts, or how different groups of users fundamentally use our systems in very different ways – ultimately revealing unexpected findings that improve our understanding.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4.    Support bold design concepts</strong></p> <p><br /> Data is more likely to encourage creative design than to supress it. When UX design principles are based on data-driven research, the outcome is highly personalised and optimised.</p> <p> </p> <p>Design is often seen as subjective in the technology industry, but research findings can help gain buy-in from stakeholders and clients. Stakeholders ultimately just want a solution that works and works well. Making decisions based on evidence gathered from actual user research and data, will help them gain confidence in the proposed solution.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/UXDataInfographic-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>UX problems are complex (sometimes in their simplicity), and so solutions must be sought through evidence-based experimentation, practice and collaboration. Data provides the ultimate quantitative evidence to prove or falsify our instincts. Data should drive a responsive and improving UX, which then drives new data for measurement and observation. This is a valuable process which can create momentum of its own, resulting in an ever-evolving data-driven UX cycle.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why Design Sprints fail</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/WhydesignsprintsfailFBV2.png" style="width: 800px; height: 418px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Developed by Google Ventures, a Design Sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers or stakeholders. While Design Sprints are great for validating ideas and solving big challenges, they don’t always work. Getting people to clear their schedules for a week is already challenging, even more so when that week results in wasted efforts.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/WhyDesignSprintsfailV2.png" style="width: 800px; height: 376px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>When Design Sprints begin to fail there are usually clear indicators. Without proper facilitation and structure, arguments erupt, participation declines, users become disinterested and management support starts decreasing.</p> <p> </p> <p>The problem comes from thinking that this methodology is a one-size-fits-all solution to any problem. When having this mindset, there is a high probability the sprint will not provide the value you are expecting.</p> <p> </p> <p>Below are four reasons why Design Sprints fail and how you can avoid them:</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li><strong>You don’t actually need a Design Sprint</strong></li> </ol> <p>Not every problem is suitable for a Design Sprint, so ensure the problem that you’re bringing to the sprint is worth solving. In instances where the scope of the problem is either too broad or too narrow, or if there’s already a well-defined product that is ready for development, a Design Sprint would not be the right tool. Before running a sprint ask whether the problem is big enough for it to need a week or if it’s just a project that needs a shorter workshop.</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li value="2"><strong>There’s not enough variety of stakeholders in the room</strong></li> </ol> <p>A successful Design Sprint needs a variety of people within the organisation in the room in order to produce the best results. The key is to get all voices: operational, finance, strategic, customer, executive and objective views to help solve problems from as many angles as possible, and unlock creativity. This requires the business to take several of their employees off existing projects and get them working together for an entire week. Even though this seems onerous, it’s crucial for the process to be successful, and a Design Sprint should not take place if you cannot get the right people in the room.</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li value="3"><strong>You’re solving the wrong problem</strong></li> </ol> <p>Or you’re trying to solve multiple disparate problems at the same time. Ensure everyone in the room knows what problem to focus on and that they don’t get side-tracked by other issues during the process. Design Sprints are quick and demanding, and the key to success is to have a well-prepared team with a clearly defined problem statement. Even though five days seem long, it goes by quickly when people get distracted.</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li value="4"><strong>You’re losing track of the Design Sprint process</strong></li> </ol> <p>Design Sprints follow a simple framework. This is easy to accomplish in the week, but the team must be focused and have experience working in a fast-paced environment. Keeping a Design Sprint on time and on target is crucial, and should be administered by an experienced facilitator who has the authority and assertiveness to ensure the sprint stays on track. The key is to trust in the process and stick to the exercises.</p> <p> </p> <p>Design Sprints are not just for design. It’s a tool for solving problems and validating solutions, and can be used in a wide range of contexts. But it’s not a silver bullet and won’t solve every problem. Most of these risks can be managed by an experienced facilitator who knows how to ensure the right problem is addressed, a balance of viewpoints is present, and the Design Sprint process is followed correctly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Best practices for building developer-friendly APIs</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Bestpracticesfrobuildingdeveloper-friendlyAPIs.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be among a company's greatest assets but can also be among their greatest liabilities. Poorly designed APIs lead to an endless queue of consequences followed by a bad reputation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The API is an interface which software engineers use to interact with the data, and a well-crafted API just makes their lives that much easier. APIs allow fellow software engineers to create software to access and interact with your application. If your API is not robust, maintainable and developer-friendly, there is a risk of your API being used incorrectly or not used at all. The more consumer-friendly your API is, the more people can and will integrate with it.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Although you don’t have complete control over what users do with your API, here are best practices for building developer-friendly APIs:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1.    Build your API using ubiquitous language</strong></p> <p><br /> Don’t confuse your user by using inconsistent language across the different API calls and response formats. The API should reflect a single, uniform language used in the domain by the business – and hopefully the industry as well. For example, avoid a response ‘transaction’ in one instance and 'order’ in another when referring to the same entity.</p> <p><br /> When building your API, take the principle of least astonishment, also called the principle of least surprise, into account. The principle states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; hence the behaviour should not astonish, confuse or surprise the API consumers.</p> <p><br />  <br /> <strong>2.    Understand your audience</strong></p> <p><br /> Knowing who your target audience is can refine both API functionality and segment future integration possibilities. Your API needs to have real-world use cases and should not be built based on assumptions of what your audience would want. Build for an existing need, and if you don’t have one, do the market research by speaking to relevant stakeholders. Leverage user feedback, and test and consume your API yourself.</p> <p><br />  <br /> <strong>3.    Chatty vs. chunky APIs</strong></p> <p><br /> One of the challenges of building any API is designing your it in such a way that is both useable for a wide variety of consumers, but also with minimal overhead, understanding and effort required to perform an operation. An API’s design can either be described as “chatty” or “chunky”, which refers to amount of calls the API requires for a single logical operation.</p> <p><br /> •    Chatty APIs require you to have to do multiple calls to perform a single operation. Chatty APIs are often not favoured because requiring multiple network calls will slow down an application’s responsiveness. You also need to have the knowledge of what to call, when. An example of a chatty API would be if you need to collect resources for a section in web application, it might force you to get needed info for each object separately.</p> <p><br /> •    Chunky APIs include more information in the payloads and do more with single calls. A chunky API will create are fewer calls, but can do more, or return more information. Of course, there are limits to how chunky it should be. With chunky APIs, there is less flexibility for the consumers, resulting in less possible variety in use of the API. Overly prescriptive results in less creativity.</p> <p><br /> Both have their advantages and limitations, and a balance should be found between the two – depending on the requirements of your API.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ChattyvsChunky.png" /><br />  <br />  <br /> <strong>4.    Design with performance in mind</strong></p> <p><br /> It’s important to define the time and payload size limits of each API call so that consumers know what performance to expect from each call. However, be careful not to over-optimise. Design with performance in mind, but the design should not focus on performance only. You would still need to be mindful of the API usability and maintainability.<br />  <br /> You would need to adequately test the API and incorporate automated testing to ensure that non-functional requirements are met. The tests should be representative of the production usage and load, e.g. databases should be representative of production data, the number of calls and distribution thereof should mimic expected usage.</p> <p><br />  <br /> <strong>5.    Enable clear error reporting  </strong></p> <p><br /> Error or status codes are almost the last thing that you want to see in an API response. However, using correct error codes is extremely valuable to the consumer of your API, and beneficial to your development team. Error responses should have the right level of detail of what went wrong and should send the necessary information back to API consumer. With a simple error code and resolution explanation, you’ve not only communicated the cause of the error, but the intended functionality and method to fix said error.</p> <p><br /> Utilise features of the technology protocols rather than using custom error reporting, e.g. apply HTTP response codes when using HTTP protocol according to level 2 of the Richardson Maturity Model for RESTful interfaces.</p> <p><br /> <strong> <br /> 6.    API documentation</strong></p> <p><br /> Your API should be accompanied by good documentation and should give your consumer guidelines on various aspects, such as expected response times. It needs to explain the domain and its ubiquitous language where the API cannot, including providing high-level context to piece things together. Using diagrams for this often helps. Following these guidelines should eliminate any ambiguity of certain terms used in the ubiquitous language, such as the 'transaction’ versus ‘order’ instance.</p> <p> </p> <p>In general, an effective API design would be easy to read and work with, hard to misuse, and would be complete and concise. As the saying goes, “A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.”</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>But is it art ?</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Butisitart-41.png" /></p> <p><br /> Traditionally one of the most common understandings of what the software engineers do on a development team is that they are individuals that turn caffeine and pizza into code. While this usually gets a giggle or two, it is obviously not the whole picture. The fact of the matter is that when it comes to understanding what developers do, very few people can empathise with the “coders” on a team and the role they play in the development process.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Butisitart-01.png" /></p> <p><br />  <br /> Over many years in various parts of the software industry, I’ve started seeing and appreciating the similarities between the creation of a piece of software and the creation of a piece of art – and to that end, I would like to propose an analogy between the two. I’m a believer that everyone on a software development team is a developer. Whether you test, design or write code, you are part of the development process, and therefore you are a developer. However, for the sake of the analogy, I’ll be referring to the coders or software engineers on the team as developers.</p> <p><br /> The software development life cycle (SDLC) has many facets to it, but the basic gist of it is that software exists to solve a need a user may have. Most people in the industry would agree that there is a basic flow across all methodologies.</p> <p><br /> First, the user’s need should be identified. Their need may be based on existing software, it may be a new feature, or it may be a need that they or the world don’t even know they have yet.</p> <p><br /> Secondly, a solution needs to be designed to meet the user’s need. At this point, there are many people involved, such as the user, some sort of design element and the engineering team. Whether they brainstorm, story map, use design thinking or just chat around a whiteboard; the point is there is a collaborative effort to design a solution to solve the need.</p> <p><br /> After the solution has been designed, something needs to be built. This leads into some form of engineering phase. This is where the developers code the actual implementation of the solution.</p> <p><br /> Once the engineering is done, there is a testing phase with a little to and fro with the engineering phase to ensure the solution is viable and works as expected.</p> <p><br /> After everyone is happy with the testing outcomes the software is handed over to the user.</p> <p><br /> Most people will agree, that this process is more or less the same irrespective of the methodology you use to support your SDLC. The actual methodology is irrelevant. The intention of this article isn’t necessarily to explain the SDLC, instead, to build an analogy between the engineering phase and the creation of a piece of art.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What makes up art?</strong></p> <p><br /> Let’s use a painting. Broadly speaking, there is some sort of canvas for the artist to work with. The artist has access to various types of brushes, and is skilled in making use of different strokes and techniques to visualise their envisioned image onto the canvas.</p> <p><br /> To create the painting, artists mix colours to create new ones, they test different strokes and brushes create different effects to put everything together to create a piece of art. They experiment and explore to get to their final work of art.</p> <p><br /> Whether it’s spray paint and a wall, watercolours on paper, or oil paint on a cloth; an image is formed for someone else to enjoy.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What makes up software?</strong></p> <p><br /> Software is very much like an ogre – and no I don’t mean ugly like an ogre. Or at least I hope not! Everyone should be creating beautiful software for your users. But, by now, everyone should know that ogres are like onions. Onions have layers, and just as onions and ogres have layers, software has layers too. There are many aspects to a piece of software over and above what the user sees and experiences. The developers and the architects reading this may argue that it’s not as simple, and they are 100% correct, but this is the crux of what I need for my analogy.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Butisitart-02.png" /><br />  </p> <p>At the top there is a user interface (UI) layer. This is the layer where the user can see information or enter data, and where they touch, slide, click and scroll. Overall it is what the user experiences.</p> <p><br /> Below the UI layer, there is a layer of logic and processing. This is where the data coming from the user is processed. This layer does the number crunching and deciphers what to feed back to the user. The user interacts with this layer through a user interface. The last layer is where data is persisted for later use.</p> <p><br /> In these layers, there are many tools. These tools range from the languages we use such as C# or Java, constructs in these languages, and the ifs and loops to help with flow control – algorithms we have learnt. There are all sorts of frameworks, platforms and integrations at our disposal to solve problems and meet the needs of our users. These are very much like our colours, brushes, techniques and canvases all used to form something useful for a user to enjoy.</p> <p><br /> <strong>The engineering</strong></p> <p><br /> The process until now has been focused on creating something that meets the user’s needs, but the engineering phase is where the developers must solve the problems that were created by the solution. For most people, this part of the lifecycle is a black hole, and this is where I want to pause to connect the analogy to a piece of art. Much like the artists, the engineers need to sit down and use their tools, mix and match, experiment and explore to implement the desired solution.</p> <p><br /> There is no one way to approach these problems – the possibilities are endless. This is where c creativity needs to flow. To build on to the analogy, each developer (and team for that matter) will also have a unique way of using the tools to come up with a solution.</p> <p><br /> If you are a developer, you walk out of the story mapping, design thinking session or whichever collaborative exercise your team uses, with a whole cacophony of ideas. While we are one step closer to creating something that meets the users’ needs, we have now just created a whole lot of problems for the engineers.</p> <p><br /> Our tools may be technical, and our problems may be technical, but we need to get creative when putting it all together in a solution.</p> <p><br /> As Vasco Duarte said about knowledge work, “It is in doing the work that we discover the work that needs to be done”. Let that sink in for a moment. Even though we already have a solution, there is a whole lot of discovery that needs to take place to turn it into a final software product.</p> <p><br /> My intent isn’t necessarily to provide a checklist to solve this matter, but rather to create awareness for possible communication barriers within the SDLC that need to be overcome. A great place to start is to visualise. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Butisitart-03.png" /></p> <p><br />  <br /> The intention is, however, to create a bit of empathy for the engineers and what they do after a solution has been designed. At the end of the day, someone needs to solve the problems created by the solution. Thus, my question to you is: “But is it art?”</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>7 business and technology trends to look out for in 2020</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 8:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/7business.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Over the past decade, buzzwords like “disruption” and “blockchain” were all the hype, along with some curiosity and confusion around the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The big question for businesses moving into 2020 is how to start leveraging these disruptive technology and business trends.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are clear indicators that trends like automation, cloud strategies and leveraging data will continue to be utilised by organisations throughout the coming decade. These and a few others make up the 7 business and technology trends to look out for in 2020:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. Data-driven decision making</strong></p> <p><br /> Data-driven decision making (DDDM) is the process of making organisational decisions based on actual data rather than intuition or observation alone. Organisations will better leverage historic data, operational data, and usage data to guide strategic decisions. However, having vast amounts of data at your disposal is not the advantage, but rather how it’s being leveraged. Data is only as valuable as the insights you can draw from it, and with all the information that’s floating about, it’s easy to find yourself being led astray. Businesses that will truly benefit from DDDM are the ones who have effective data strategies in place, target data according to business objectives, and turn insights into action.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Automation for elevated job functions</strong></p> <p><br /> Automation has been widely discussed over the last decade. Moving forward, automation will be introduced into large organisations to eliminate menial work. This won’t necessarily lead to job losses, but the aim would rather be to free up employees to perform more meaningful tasks, such as improving customer experience and offering tactical decision making in operational work. Organisations leveraging automation will significantly reduce time spent on manual, repetitive work and cut down on human error.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. An increase in instant apps and progressive web apps (PWAs)</strong></p> <p><br /> More people than ever before are online and the ways they’re accessing the web are ever-changing. Mobile usage is surpassing desktop and the trend will only continue, as more people around the globe primarily use mobile devices to access the internet through mobile websites and apps. That being said, the need for bulky mobile applications will diminish, and organisations will opt for leaner, cheaper and more versatile instant applications and web applications that look and feel like native apps in the coming years. In future, fully fledged mobile app offerings will mainly be for flagship products where there can be no compromise on user experience.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. Cloud adoption and utilisation</strong></p> <p><br /> Although there has been mass adoption of cloud technologies over the last few years, it has mainly been centred around replicating on-premises bare metal architectures on the cloud. Organisations will now better harness the services and solutions available on cloud for improved delivery, reliability, scale, and cost. Altogether, cloud services offer unparalleled potential for improving business performance and increasing profits. Cloud technologies alleviate complex processes for getting software in the hands of customers, allow for rapid development and testing of hypothesis, and provide more reliability in serving products and services.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5. Digital twins and simulating the business</strong></p> <p><br /> Organisations will realise the opportunity in modelling their business digitally and utilising data to adjust operations on an almost real-time basis. This will allow businesses to improve ongoing processes, train employees, and test new products or services before launching them to the real world, where it becomes more expensive and complicated to fix issues.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>6. Microservices and micro apps</strong></p> <p><br /> Similar to microservices, micro apps provide highly focused, task-based functionality that let users get in, interact, and get out with maximum efficiency. Both microservices and micro apps are meant to be lightweight, and the concepts hold great importance for enterprise mobility strategies. As we’re moving more and more towards the world of “micro”, organisations will embrace building focused, lean, and well-defined applications over large scale applications that do too much. This allows for validating assumptions and business models with quicker feedback loops.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>7. Growing stronger teams through collaboration</strong></p> <p><br /> The final business trend worth addressing is that of breaking down silos through collaboration. Organisations will begin to place more emphasis on growing stronger teams versus stronger individuals. Instead of business units working independently, teams with different goals but the same vision will start working more tightly together. These stronger, more agile teams will break out of the traditional ways of work to a more collaborative, lean and aligned way of work.</p> <p> </p> <p>2020 is filled with great business opportunity and challenges for organisations to become more efficient, elevate their customer experience, and offer effective products and services. This will be accomplished by leveraging technology, critical evaluation of strategic goals, and evolving working culture for a new age. These seven trends are guiding principles that can help make this a reality.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>When a stranger calls - The hidden generation of digital customers</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 11:19:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Whenastrangercallsv1.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>There’s a new generation of customers. Customers who are more informed, more experienced and more digital. And they’re not answering your calls anymore.</p> <p> </p> <p>If your organisation is still one of the few who only communicate with customers via a call centre, you are alienating a large portion of potential clients. The State of Global Customer Service Report by Microsoft showcased the rising expectations of digitally empowered customers. According to the report, 74% of customers aged between 18-34 have a more favourable view of brands that respond to customer service questions or complaints on social media, and 79% of customers in that age group prefer brands that offer a mobile-responsive customer service support portal. A surprising and sobering statistic for many large, traditional businesses.</p> <p> </p> <p>But it’s not only technologically savvy Millennials who prefer engaging over digital mediums. 66% of global respondents of all ages stated that they prefer omni-channel services and actively use at least 3 channels to engage with businesses – a blind spot that is often overlooked by brands.</p> <p> </p> <p>Despite these statistics, organisations have always been led to believe that customers prefer a more personal approach – hence the investment in call centres and phone calls. But not all transactions need to be personal. Let’s take the customer journey of buying a car as an example. Digital customers do all their research online and are often more informed than the sales representatives or call centre agents who contact them. When buying a car, they have done all the research and have essentially already made up their minds by the time they send through an enquiry. The only thing that the agent can really do at that point is talk the potential customer out of a sale.</p> <p> </p> <p>Chances are, when a customer sends through a product enquiry, they have sent that same request to your competitors, and receiving call-backs on every enquiry instead of an online response on the digital medium they used is disruptive. Then there’s also the added frustrations of trying to spell out their name and address to the agent over the phone, dealing with agents who aren’t informed enough to deal with their questions, and having to repeat information over and over again while being transferred from agent to agent.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Whycustomersavoidcalls-in-lineimage.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Where to from here?</strong></p> <p><br /> It’s clear that customers are becoming more digital by the year and it’s often difficult to keep up with constantly-evolving trends. The world’s largest messenger apps – WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook Messenger – had a combined user base of over 4 billion at the end of 2019. The value in engaging, serving and selling to customers on these platforms is monumental.</p> <p> </p> <p>Organisations who don’t have effective omni-channel strategies in place; inclusive of email comms, live chat functionality, instant messaging and call centres, are the ones stuck with a blind spot of customers they’ll never reach. These customers won’t complain about the lack of communication channels, but would rather move on to the next best service provider. Avoid these blind spots by asking your customers how they prefer to be contacted and taking active steps to offer more digital ways to engage with your products.</p> <p> </p> <p>The truth is, a big portion of customers do still prefer the personal connection that phone calls offer and they should not be ignored. But in a digital world, alienating an entire generation of digital-only customers is dangerous when your competitors are always at their fingertips.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Overcoming human irrationality with UX</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8"> <title></title> <p><strong>Overcoming human irrationality with UX</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>“Forget about your competitors, just focus on your customers.” This seems like a simple-yet-bold statement by Alibaba co-founder, Jack Ma. But do we as organisations really know our customers? Or do we just think that we do?</p> <p> </p> <p>We often believe that our customers are rational thinkers that make decisions based on what is best for them. However, it has often been proven that humans are irrational beings, often making decisions that are not based on facts or data, but rather on what makes them feel good. This is because humans are inherently emotional beings.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>“Our thinking is riddled with systematic mistakes known to psychologists as cognitive biases. And they affect everything we do. They make us spend impulsively, be overly influenced by what other people think. They affect our beliefs, our opinions and our decisions, and we have no idea it is happening.” – Toby Macdonald</em></p> <p> </p> <p>Taking users’ emotions and attitudes into account, user experience (UX) engineering is the process used to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.<br /> If we look at this from a psychological aspect, it means addressing the clear drivers and blockers that contribute to why a user behaves towards a particular stimulus.</p> <p> </p> <p>Below are 2 short case studies on how companies relied on UX principles to understand human irrationality:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. The optimal level of challenge </strong></p> <p><br /> During the 1950s, General Mills food company released a branded, do-it-yourself cake mix. Each box contained all the ingredients required to bake the cake; packaged as a packet of dry ingredients, which included milk and eggs. All that was needed to bake the cake was to line a cake tin, add water to the mix and place the batter into the oven.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/UX-graph.png" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px; float: left; width: 250px;" />When the product didn’t sell General Mills decided to bring in a team of psychologists to determine why this was the case. They discovered that the targeted users believed that it was just <em>too easy</em>. They couldn’t impress anyone with their cooking skills, as it felt like they were cheating.</p> <p> </p> <p>The company then decided to complicate the product slightly by adding in a single step to the process; to “add an egg'”. They relaunched the product and sales went through the roof, turning the negative user emotion of ’cheating’ into the positive emotion of ’participation’ in the process.</p> <p> </p> <p>Part of this can be attributed to the optimal level of challenge. The framework states that if something is too easy, it causes negative emotions due to boredom. It also states that if something is too challenging, it also causes negative emotions due to stress. At both ends, the user often chooses to abandon the task.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. The paradox of choice</strong></p> <p><br /> There is a theory that believes when providing more options to people, there will be something for everyone, resulting in more conversions. However, <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20(2000).pdf">a study about jams</a> conducted in 2000 by psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper proved that more choice equals less conversions.</p> <p> </p> <p>The study took place at a local food market shopping centre with a table display with 24 different types jams on it. On a different day, the same table only had 6 different jams on it. While the table with the 24 jams was visited more often, the table with 6 variations saw a conversion rate that was 10 times higher.</p> <p> </p> <p>The leading theory is that the more data we’re required to process before making a decision, the more strained the brain becomes. Less was more in this instance, but it isn’t always the case, and a balance needs to be found with your consumers.</p> <p> </p> <p>In order for organisations to focus on their customers effectively, they need to know their customers’ mindsets and cognitive biases – something that is often easier said than done. Although each of these case studies had different problems that needed to be solved, the approach remained the same. They went about trying to truly understand their customers’ mindsights and behaviours to solve a business problem.</p> <p> </p> <p>Understanding user behaviour is key to finding out how users interact with your product and brand. There are a variety of <a href="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=64885">UX techniques and strategies</a> that an organisation can look at, depending on the problems that need to be solved. An example of this would be user interviews. This is a well-established technique used to get qualitative information from a target audience. If we take the case of General Mills, if they had conducted user interviews they would have been able to draw critical insights form their target user groups.</p> <p> </p> <p>Humans are irrational beings, but if you invest the time and effort into genuinely understanding your customers’ needs, it can be leveraged to provide value not just for your customers but for your organisation too. The fact is, if you don’t meet those needs, your competitors will, and your customers will go elsewhere.</p> <p> </p> <div> <div> </div> </div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Transforming your data deluge from a liability into an asset</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Datadeluge.png" style="width: 800px; height: 418px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>There has been a considerable focus on amassing and storing data over the past decade: the more data collected, the better. But when the volume of new data being generated is overwhelming the capacity of institutions to manage it and researchers to make use of it, it turns into a data deluge.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/1.Diagram.png" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px; float: right; width: 350px; height: 312px;" />The world’s total digital data volume has been doubling every two years. In their <a href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/trends/files/idc-seagate-dataage-whitepaper.pdf">Data Age report</a>, the International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that 175 zettabytes of data will be generated annually by 2025. Yes, <em>zettabytes</em>!</p> <p> </p> <p>Apart from traditional data sources, there are numerous digital data sources that have made it difficult to aggregate, visualise and analyse information efficiently. Having all these various sources at hand has caused many organisations to collect and store as much data as possible – often way more than is actually needed.</p> <p> </p> <p>Data is easily accessible and virtually inexpensive to store, and thus masses of data is kept with the belief that it could be useful <em>one day</em>. But floods of almost completely futile data cause data scientists to focus less on data analysis and more on data scrubbing. This means that most of their time is spent struggling with inefficient cleaning processes to make data usable. Data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data scientists – a tedious task that can be reduced by focusing on quality over quantity when data is collected.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/2.Diagram.png" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px; width: 400px; height: 296px;" /></p> <p><br /> Another contributing factor to the upsurge of data in recent years is more convenient access to the cloud. Because of the relatively low costs of storage, cloud technologies are promoting carelessness with the volume of data that is being stored. Instead of organisations sorting through it and keeping only what’s needed, data is piling up in a bigger drawer of junk data – a <em>data deluge</em>.  </p> <p> </p> <p>But there’s light the end of the tunnel. If you suspect that you might be guilty of data hoarding, below are 3 ways to turn your masses of data from a liability into an asset:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. Build a data strategy</strong><br /> Whether you’re a big data giant or a family-run business, all successful businesses begin with a strategy. And these days, all companies of all sizes and in all industries need a data strategy. Ask yourself what business problem needs to be solved and what data is needed. From there, start thinking about how the data will be collected and analysed. Keep in mind that, like any business improvement process, things may shift or evolve along the way. You may find that you need to revisit your existing data strategy along the way and make some modifications to adapt to the organisation’s needs.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Identify the causes of your data challenges</strong><br /> In order to truly master your data, you need to identify some key challenges. Does your data live in multiple, siloed, legacy data systems? Do you have numerous sources of data? Does data cleansing and standardisation only occur in isolated data sources? To reap the benefits of useful data, relevant stakeholders in your organisation need to understand and appreciate the role of data governance, and take time to regularly review data rules and processes.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.  Simplify your data</strong><br /> Establish a process to simplify and standardise data collection, analysis and presentation. This will allow you to quickly sort through data lakes and find exactly what you need, while discarding chunks of futile data. Your data strategy should include automated policies to ensure data remains consistent and data quality is standardised across your organisation. As soon as internal data management guidelines are in place, simplifying data will become easier and a <em>“less is more”</em> culture can start developing.</p> <p> </p> <p>Technology today has made data collection more seamless than ever. This ability is both a blessing and a curse. When you <em><u>can</u></em> collect anything you want, the challenge is deciding what you <em><u>should</u></em> collect. The focus needs to slowly start shifting towards rich data instead of big data, because bigger data isn’t always better data.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Should you be worried about serverless lock-in?</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ServerlessImage.png" style="width: 800px; height: 418px;" /><br />  </p> <p>Serverless architecture is the inevitable future for most organisations, as major players in the technology sector are moving towards cloud platforms. This is due to cloud vendors’ abilities to provision and manage major computer resources, and drastically reduce the time-to-market. With the growing interest in serverless architecture, the market is expected to reach $7.7 billion by 2021.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/GRAPH-Serverless.png" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px; float: left; width: 250px;" />Sound too good to be true? Well, sort of. Most serverless architectures come with a risk called ‘vendor lock-in’. Vendor lock-in is where customers are dependent (i.e. locked-in) on a single cloud provider’s technology implementation, and cannot easily move to a different vendor in future without substantial costs, legal constraints or technical incompatibilities.<br />  </p> <p>However, the real concern is how much you should allow these considerations to influence decisions about whether or not to commit to a particular serverless platform vendor. The reality is that there is always a degree of lock-in with any technology choice, and serverless is no different. Vendor lock-in is a reality, whether you are choosing a database, a programming language, or an operating system, and serverless is no different.<br />  </p> <p>Vendor lock-in is just another risk that comes with technology choices. But, like other risks, being tightly coupled to one cloud provider’s services has its rewards. You get scalability, resilience and security in return, and can launch products to market earlier and iterate on them quicker. Because going serverless minimises the amount of undifferentiated heavy lifting that has to be done, you can better focus on creating business value.<br />  </p> <p>As with any technology move, however, it's a good idea to assess the potential risk and impact when choosing a vendor.<br />  </p> <p>The first step is to check which programming languages and software development kits (SDKs) are supported by the vendors you’re considering. This will save you from incurring massive costs if and when you do decide to migrate to a different platform that shares the same language. If you realise during a migration that your new vendor does not support your chosen language, it will open a whole new set of problems to address before the migration can begin.<br />  </p> <p>The next big challenge after committing to the chosen language is to consider transferrable solution architectures. A good architectural pattern will make any future migrations of serverless functions much easier. If the base code remains the same during migration, the costs come down automatically.<br />  </p> <p>When choosing a cloud provider, the question isn’t necessarily whether you should be worried about being locked in, but rather what considerations need to be in place before committing to a single vendor. Migrating from one vendor to another is not impossible, but costly and risky when done impulsively.<br />  </p> <p>Serverless platforms and services should be exploited for the right use cases. It can be cost-effective for burst and batch type workload scenarios, proof of concepts and low consistent-load systems. But for more traditional websites with predictable loads, there are more economical solutions to utilise. Being “cloud-ready” is the right proactive move, but be sure that going serverless is the best solution for your organisation when considering costs, integrations and scalability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Optimise-and-shift: Finding value in pragmatic cloud migration</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 8:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Optimise-and-shift.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The (r)evolution of cloud computing has been a significant focus in industry for the past decade, where organisations are often attracted to the possibility that cloud migration can lead to the benefits of cost savings and flexibility. While cloud benefits are clear, the best model and approach for migration can be less obvious, and organisations frequently waste time on debating this. While the chosen model and approach for a cloud migration is significant, the focus should rather be on optimisation.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Cloud optimisation is the process of correctly selecting and assigning the right resources to a workload or application, i.e. rightsizing. Organisations are often left feeling disappointed when they migrate their workloads to the public cloud because it does not live up to the efficiencies and savings that they have been promised. In some cases, costs even go up when compared to an on-premise alternative. This is mainly due to the lack of optimisation before beginning their cloud migration journey.</p> <p> </p> <p>Instead of focusing on a holistic cloud migration approach, the business often gets stuck on choosing a migration approach. The three main approaches often debated are: lift-and-shift, replatform, and refactor.</p> <p><br /> •    <strong>Rehost (AKA lift-and-shift)</strong><br /> Essentially a forklift approach to migrating applications to the cloud, moving them without any code modification.</p> <p><br /> <strong>•    Replatform</strong><br /> Code is not altered excessively, however, replatforming involves a bit of modification for the purpose of taking advantage of the new cloud infrastructure.</p> <p><br /> <strong>•    Refactor</strong><br /> A more advanced process of rearchitecting and often recoding some portion of an existing application to take advantage of cloud-native frameworks and functionality.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Most existing workloads are overprovisioned, meaning that organisations are allocating more computer data storage space than is strictly necessary. Although choosing an approach is unavoidable, none of them would be effective when inundated with inessential data. Instead of leveraging cloud technologies and services to become more efficient, without optimisation and a proper cloud strategy, organisations will just migrate existing inefficiencies to a new location.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In cloud computing, you pay Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers on a monthly basis. But depending on how much computing power you use, your costs can vary wildly, which is often why organisations feel that remaining on-premise is the more cost-effective option. This can be avoided by establishing a baseline of resources needed in the cloud, turning off idle instances, and ensuring that servers aren’t running any unnecessary or bloated services.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no one-size-fits-all transition for moving an application from your on-premises data centre to the cloud. It’s important to recognise which components are worth migrating and which would be better left unchanged. In order to ensure a pragmatic cloud migration, organisations ideally need to identify which components are low-effort, high-value optimisations. Every business’ process and cloud strategy is different, and the below diagram should only be used as an indication on how to categorise and prioritise these components.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Screenshot2020.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">There are often components or modules that are relatively easily adapted to a cloud hosting configuration and will yield most benefits from a cloud migration. These should be a first priority during optimisation. At the other end, it’s important to recognise the high-effort, low-value components. Focusing on migrating these components will result in a waste of time, effort and money, without yielding any benefits the cloud provides.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Optimisation should be seen as an ongoing exercise, as organisations continuously migrate applications and systems. Costs can be easily be hidden and become lost as lists of components grow over time. Continued rightsizing, and a clear picture of where and why every service is being used is the only way to avoid overprovisioning.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Organisations are much more likely to see real value when they view migration as an opportunity to rationalise their computing and storage practices. A cloud migration presents an opportunity for spring cleaning, and taking the time to put together a migration strategy will be valuable in terms of cost, time and effort in the long run. When companies optimise their workloads, they can reap all these benefits of the public cloud and actually save time and money in the process.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>3 reasons why UX is important for your internal systems</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/UXforinternalsystems.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Historically – and understandably – the focus for user interface and user experience (UI/UX) has been prioritised for customer-facing software. Naturally, you want your customers to have the best experience possible to drive product differentiation, uptake and retention.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, technology for employees is seen as a means to an end, rather than an integral part of business strategy. New platforms and tools are introduced internally without considering how they fit into the digital workplace, how employees will respond to them, how they can be optimised, or how they can work together. The result is often a fragmented digital experience for employees, impacting on how well they can perform their roles.</p> <p> </p> <p>Below are three reasons why investing in UX for internal systems is critical, and growing:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. People’s roles are more complex than ever</strong><br /> Thanks to technological advancements in areas such as robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI), menial tasks are easy to automate and internal admin-heavy roles diminishing. This has resulted in the creation of more complex roles where employees need to use more judgement, make more decisions, and understand products and customers to solve complex problems – the type of problems that RPA and AI can't address.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you consider an employee who works in a call centre, they would need access to multiple systems when receiving a call from a customer. Customers expect your employees to have an oversight on their profile, products they’re linked to, transaction or product history, and many other factors core to your business. It is unrealistic to integrate all these systems seamlessly, and there should be an effort made to aid these complex roles as much as possible.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/UXgraphic.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. We need to stop serving ourselves last</strong><br /> We all recognise the importance of UX for customers – and that shouldn’t change. But completely neglecting the internal systems your employees need to work on daily will have a negative impact on the business and will actually not be cheaper in the long run. Employees become less productive when systems are not intuitive, and it’s more difficult to recruit and train new team members.</p> <p> </p> <p>Systems should be inviting and clear for employees to get their jobs done, instead of just assuming that they will figure it out even if the UX is bad. Internal systems should present an obvious interface that doesn’t need a manual. Streamlined UX for employee software is directly translated into a streamlined workflow.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. Poor internal UX will eventually cross the boundary and affect customers</strong><br /> Businesses often overlook internal systems because customers won’t have to interact with it. However, eventually the experience will jump the gap from internal to external, and customers will be affected by bad UX.</p> <p> </p> <p>These consequences can range from frustrated customers noticing when call centre employees are struggling to find their information, to more serious cyber security or privacy issues. Poor UX can also lead to more human errors, which can be very costly (even as costly as this <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90157153/don-norman-what-went-wrong-in-hawaii-human-error-nope-bad-design">fake missile threat alert</a> in Hawaii in 2018). Taking the time to evaluate the internal user experience and investing in the necessary changes will result in better business value. Compare the technology you use internally to your consumer platforms and establish what can be improved. Seek feedback from employees on their main frustrations, what could work better and how they can be engaged more effectively.</p> <p> </p> <p>The principles that apply to how you design systems around your customers (their needs, roles, feedback and behaviour) are exactly the same for your employees. Employees should be elevated to first class users, empowering them further to drive productivity and sentiment. The easier it is for your employees to fill their role, the better experience they can craft for your customers.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The growing importance of an executive with technology savvy</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Technologysavvy.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>In today’s business climate, every company’s strategy is anchored around technology. To maintain a competitive edge is to prioritise innovation, and in most instances that translates to some sort of technology.<br />  </p> <p>Inside every boardroom, the dialogue is about differentiation, adaptation or innovation. There are endless ideas being tabled, most of which rely on technology as the enabler. Digital transformation usually means crossing vertical product lines or introducing entirely new customer-facing products, all made possible with modern tech.<br />  </p> <p>After the excitement of the green light, these projects are then too quickly delegated out to engineering teams or are outsourced to vendors. Due to the misconception that executives don’t need to understand technology in detail, projects are distributed without them staying closely–enough connected to the subsequent execution. The ideology that the engineering teams “know what I want” puts these projects on a course to disaster. There are important decisions to be made, and many options to explore which require executive and business insight – these are not just “details”.<br />  </p> <p>Below are a few reasons why tech competency and understanding are critical at that highest decision-making levels.<br />  </p> <p><strong>1. Internal decision-making relies on tech knowledge</strong><br /> Executive teams with only business knowledge won‘t be able to evaluate the engineering requirements of a project idea.<br />  </p> <p>Without technology insights within management, it’s not possible to short-circuit product or project ideas. Technical insight allows us to identify obvious low-effort solutions that could avoid costly engineering involvement altogether or upfront.<br />  </p> <p>Explaining the problem properly gets a better solution. If you understand the technology, you can explain the problem and expectations better. This closes the understanding gap, sets a coherent project path and saves a lot of time.<br />  </p> <p>These decisions cannot come from lower- or mid-level management, such as technology or team leads, because they still lack holistic context into business, history, strategy or product.<br />  </p> <p><strong>2. There is a natural trust boundary between the business and a vendor</strong><br /> In any project with a technology partner, there is an implicit and unavoidable trust boundary present due to the existence of a commercial engagement. This boundary can create friction when the business doesn’t understand what the vendor is doing, and rely entirely on decisions and advice exclusively from the “other side” of that boundary.<br />  </p> <p>This is entirely solved with an inherently-trusted internal party to sense-check, validate or oppose vendor views using business context and constraints. Critical or impactful technical decisions must be made on an informed, collective basis.<br />  </p> <p>Without a fairly detailed level of knowledge and background into technology teams’ work, the business can’t keep them honest or have constructive conversations if something breaks down. When executive teams and vendors can interrogate each other’s decisions, it creates confidence and builds more robust trust in the relationship.<br />  </p> <p><strong>3. Vendors work better with executive teams with the relevant insights</strong><br /> With any technological partnership, vendors will need to work alongside a tech representative at executive level. Someone who has the relevant history, context and technology of the business.<br />  </p> <p>It’s negligent to leave teams to run projects on their own without internal expertise and guidance, and they would never be able to gain this context on their own. Even with the best of intentions, in the absence of that context, the team cannot help but make short-sighted decisions. In these instances, engineering teams can easily go off on the wrong path, building solutions that aren’t in line with the business strategy.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/TechsavvyDIAGRAMv1.png" /><br />  </p> <p>Ultimately, executive teams need to have widespread knowledge that covers all areas of the business, which now includes technology. To draw a comparison, none of us would opt to outsource all finance and accounting responsibilities to an external service provider without deep internal understanding of what they are doing. Specifically, the ability to critique their work at both input and output levels. We would absolutely have a finance executive with the relevant financial knowledge to oversee and interrogate their work.<br /> <br />  <br /> The same applies to technology and we need to stop seeing this differently. Execs don’t all need to be technology experts, but every executive team must have a representative who holds enough experience, skill and context to steer engineering teams in the right direction.<br />  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The evolving role of IT budgets within large organisations</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ITBudget-77R.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The evolving role of IT budgets within large organisations</strong><br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">While technology has been a focal point for businesses for some time now, technology budgeting and investment practices have been lagging. With the growing need for digital transformation within large organisations, IT budgets need to shift from a project-to-project execution model to one that is capacity-based and more flexible. IT and software are becoming the products themselves and will be permanently evolving. They cannot be seen as start/stop expenses. In many cases, they are the fuel for the organisations continued growth, or even relevance, and so need to be invested in proportionally.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Traditionally, budgets have been defined and predetermined according to specific projects planned for the upcoming year, and the business sees IT as a cost centre based on these individual projects. However, as projects and technology requirements evolve from year to year, organisations should focus on building a capacitated IT competency instead, and use them as an engine room.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Technology projects are never truly done, and there are constantly new demands from customers, 3rd party partnerships and internal users. As the market and business grow, new products and features are required on a constant basis. This happens weekly or even daily – not yearly. Expanding and improving software is now part and parcel of expanding and improving business.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The diagram below highlights the differences between agile and traditional budgeting. In evolutionary budgeting approaches, the business and IT collectively decide on a budget that is proportional to role technology plays within the organisation – currently and into the future. A sensible IT budget should indicate the emphasis the organisation places on it as an investment (and sometimes an expense) relative to other capex areas. This step is specifically distinct from the concept of what that budget will be spent on. This is a ‘working forwards’ approach.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Agile budgeting allows for flexibility within teams to prioritise components instead of projects in its entirety. Because there is a readily available IT competency within the business, projects can be broken down further into a smaller granularity. These smaller components can then be executed on a purely priority-first basis, extracting maximum value from the budget. This also allows build and run investments to be mixed, making much more effective use of skills, capacity and talent. When there are budget or capacity cuts, IT can simply cut certain lower-priority components and focus on the next task at hand.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">With traditional budgeting, IT estimates costs for a list of predetermined projects for the year, and then asks the business for budget to deliver these set projects. This is a ‘working backwards’ approach, which might should more diligent but also risks being too brittle. Should budgets be changed during the year, entire projects must be cut because there is little or no granularity in each project. They are each “all or nothing” in nature.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ITbudgets-DIAGRAMR.png" style="width: 100%;" /><br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Traditional budgeting is still useful in instances where there are detailed, unchanging needs and a strict environment, whereas evolutionary budgeting relies on trust and talent from the agile teams.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Modern and flexible delivery styles are not compatible with fixed budgets. Technology is an investment regardless of how it was budgeted for – the question is the efficiency and reach of that investment. There are gaps in our budgets, and there is time and money wasted on planning which is doomed to become redundant long before the cycle ends. This is important because it means there are opportunities to ultimately fit more work into the same total budget by working smartly.<br />  </p> <p style="text-align: justify;">There is real value in the ability of the organisation to reprioritise, in this year and this budget. Better practical outcomes, less time spent re-planning and more time doing what matters on a shorter cycle. This can happen when IT and Business jointly determine a sensible budget which speaks directly to strategy, and then establish how to go about maximising that investment.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Where to start: Managing the pressure to modernise legacy systems</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Wheretostart-Banner.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Most large enterprise executives have been feeling the pressure to upgrade legacy systems due to risks, costs, missing functionality, technical debt, and the growing necessity for digital offerings in every industry. In a complex landscape with bulky IT architectures that have been assembled over decades, how do you know what to modernise and which route to take? Legacy systems are often complex, affect multiple business units, rely on niche skills, and it’s difficult to know where to start.</p> <p> </p> <p>We have previously asked the question: Is <a href="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=61128" target="_blank">upgrading your legacy systems</a> a digital advantage or a giant waste of money? To answer this, technology executives will need to look at their entire IT landscape and establish a holistic and coherent strategy which starts with a mapping out of their as-is landscape. This can become the basis for a forward plan to address each platform, system or product on a priority basis in the direction of modernisation.</p> <p> </p> <p>A practical modernisation strategy should include a wide range of initiatives tailored to each component in your map. Looking across the full picture, certain systems may not need to be modernised at all. These are stable enough to continue without any adjustments, or are planned for decommissioning. On the other hand, there will be a set of systems that are clear candidates to be replaced entirely, under the banner of innovation, risk or cost. The balance of platforms will then land in the “uncertain” category. It may not be immediately clear whether there is enough of a risk (or benefit) to modernise these systems. In these instances, further work is required to assess the best way forward.</p> <p> </p> <p>Your modernisation strategy can then be meaningfully composed of a practical and cost-effective mix of 5 approaches applied to each platform or system in your map, depending on where each one falls.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. Assess</strong><br /> Assessments are used when you’re not entirely sure whether to modernise that specific system. This step is intended to undertake a full review of the purpose, functionality and audience for this technology, and create a business case for modernisation (or against it!) If there are good reasons to proceed, the case should also recommend which strategy to deploy: re-host, rewrite, renew, retire, replace, or convert these systems.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Analyse</strong><br /> During the analysis approach, business requirements are extracted from packaged or legacy software applications to gain a deeper understanding of underlying business methods. Systems are reverse engineered in readiness to make it redundant, either with a new system, or by dissolving its responsibility across many other systems.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. Enhance</strong><br /> Legacy systems are often complex and interconnected, with lots of built up technical debt. Application remediation allows you to enhance and improve current systems’ functionality without having to replace them entirely. This avoids wasting money and time on replacing the whole system, by rather just removing a bottleneck and promoting simpler integration.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. Re-platform</strong><br /> In certain instances, a legacy application component will only need to be migrated to a newer, more efficient technology platform that has been nominated by the organisation. This is an administrative step that can reduce operational costs or licensing exposure, but also ensures consistency in the landscape by keeping things together, organised and secure.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5. Replace</strong><br /> During this approach, an application component is decommissioned entirely and replaced with a new system that takes current business needs into account. Usually this is necessary for critical line-of-business systems, competitive differentiators, or to enable new product lines which are dependent on these systems.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/WheretostartDIAGRAM-13.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The need for technology-based or supported services in every organisation means that the pressure to modernise our ecosystems will not relent. It's not only about competitive ability though. There are cost-saving opportunities where newer platforms can displace older license-intensive tools, and many modern technologies that drive the customer experience or scalability we need to differentiate. These newer technologies rely on platforms, data and functionality that a legacy technology layer can’t accommodate.</p> <p> </p> <p>So where do you start? Start with a balanced strategy. A strategy that maps out the differing modernisation needs for each system in your landscape. This becomes a list of modernisation projects which can be prioritised in a tactical and strategic way. Usually this list looks at critical risk, customer needs, business outcome and profit and outlines a holistic strategy of technology-enablement for your business.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Untangling ambiguity with design sprints</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Untanglingambiguity1.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>There are few things as powerful as getting the right people in the same room to unpack a problem. A seemingly simple recipe for problem-solving – a design sprint – does exactly that. This five-day problem-solving technique is becoming a go-to for companies who want to test ideas, develop a new product, or overcome a pressing business concern.</p> <p> </p> <p>Design sprints are mainly used in two instances:</p> <ul> <li>Innovation: When you’re on a mission to reinvent your business</li> <li>Wicked problems: Concerns that are difficult to solve because of incomplete, contradictory or changing requirements</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>The magic of this approach lies in getting different stakeholders to talk to each other. This creates a problem-solving forum where stakeholders work through complex topics as a team – through mapping, sketching and prototyping – with the help of guided facilitation. A facilitator plays a crucial role, and should guide the group, spur questions, extract thoughts and ideas, find patterns, and depict it on the “shared brain” (the map).</p> <p> </p> <p>This method is by no means a silver bullet. There are many instances where design sprints <a href="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=63601">won’t give you the result </a>you’re searching for. But, used correctly, it’s a dynamic approach that can be used to diagnose and solve critical business problems, such as unsatisfactory customer experience or tedious manual processes, in a short period of time.</p> <p> </p> <p>We surveyed four Entelect teams who have successfully facilitated design sprints at various blue-chip enterprises in the banking, insurance, car rental and mining industries, to understand what kind of problems this method can solve and how they went about solving it. The below canvas highlights the range of business problems being tackled, where the value of the sprint ultimately lays, what the teams required for the approach to work well, and what tools were utilised.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DesignSprint.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Consider any problem that your organisation or team is currently experiencing. By including representatives from functions right across the organisation, we gain perspectives that are otherwise hidden or overlooked. These people genuinely have experiences and ideas of their own, that cannot be guessed or assumed. The function of design sprints is to create a mechanism through which you can bring diverse people together for combined problem-solving, by guiding and facilitating conversations that would usually not take place.</p> <p> </p> <p>Design sprints help untangle the messiness of ambiguity, and give some structure to solving any problem and discovering quick wins. This learn-fast-fail-fast approach not only leverages a diversity of ideas and perspectives in just one week, but also forms stronger relationships and builds trust during the process, ultimately enabling participants to collaborate and solve future problems.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>DevOps: buzzword of the moment</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The overall impact was potentially less than today’s demand for accuracy and expediency, however, the interactions and flow of people, processes and systems were just as important as they are today. The combination and intra-workings of the development process and the dependency on operational components form the basis for the logical grouping of these functions into one — DevOps.<br /> <br /> The basic principles of software delivery– analyse, code, test and deploy – haven’t changed dramatically over the past few years. However, there has been a tremendous maturity seen in the supporting process and tools. This is most prevalent in the more modern and controlled software development environments, which have shortened release cycles from weeks to hours without compromising on the same quality delivery – all as a result of a high level of DevOps automation.<br /> <br /> DevOps tools have also subsequently gained focus by being further developed to accompany and enhance the preferred development methodologies. Including tasks such as automated quality assurance (QA) processes, measuring code coverage and also performing code-compilation tasks, issue tracking and the final deployment and configuration of compiled systems are now the norm.<br /> <br /> Efficiently grouping all these requirements together, while also coordinating the project’s tasks, was traditionally the responsibility of development managers. However, we have seen the empowerment of development teams to accomplish the same or similar outcomes. Reporting metrics – including backlog, delivery rate, and the related costs – to chief information officers has also been made easier.<br /> <br /> Once it is understood that every software team has some form of DevOps, many with varying levels of maturity or slants in implementation, the next step is to understand the overriding objective: to make your software delivery life cycle (or preferably an iterative cycle) and the operational requirements, as efficient and painless as possible.<br /> <br /> In our experience, clients frequently ask how quickly they can get what they want, and depend on your rapid response to change while you’re balancing development scope, time to implement and the cost, as efficiently as possible. The software development industry has been forced to embrace the creation of internal facilities to allow for this change to inevitably deal with scope creep or scope change.<br /> <br /> The underpinning of your DevOps, and the capabilities of your staff, will facilitate change without the need for embarking on another complete analysis phase. We are finding that there is a trend of pushing the develop-to-specification (traditionally a binding contract, accurate to the last full-stop) to the sidelines. Emerging businesses need to be in an entrepreneurial position to change according to market-related direction and pressures. As such, so do the companies supporting the development of their software projects.<br /> <br /> This change-management complexity exists in every operations hub within software companies worldwide. The industry's reaction is to consider and implement Agile, Scrum or Kanban methodologies to structure the flow of design principles, manage issue (defect) and change tracking, and efficiently allow the flow into release management, which ultimately results in a solid product or valuable service to a client.<br /> <br /> Principles of continuous integration and continuous build have become an integral part of modern DevOps. If you’re not currently doing these, you’re behind the curve of collaborative development and are likely to be diminishing your production quality by increasing technical debt, substituting automated operations for man-power, and increasing costs unnecessarily.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Mark Beets (GM: Business Development)</strong> <br/><br/> DevOps has, in principle, been around for decades. In the early 1980’s, DevOps was a rudimentary end-to-end process. It started with punching holes into cards (representations of code and data), quality assuring their correctness, an then physically transporting the cards to be fed into an IBM mainframe. All the while ensuring that nothing fell out or was blown away, breaking the program and causing delays in delivery.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Business Intelligence: getting back to thinking inside the box</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 7:32:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The typical BI solution consolidates multiple data sources, cleans the data to ensure accuracy and quality and then disseminates the information into a time-variant data store. The ‘traditional’ approach has several pros and cons. When implemented correctly and time variance works well, it can compensate for integration shortfalls within source systems, allowing an organisation to gather huge insights into its customer base by storing history and gathering trends. A good example of this was when the retail group Target sent a teenage customer a pregnancy-coupon kit, before she had even let her own father know she was pregnant.<br /> <br /> The converse side is that all too often, BI solutions become a ‘white elephant’ in organisations. This is largely due to the fact that there is a longer time to market and companies cannot keep up with the ever-changing businesses. When not implemented correctly, BI solutions can become a hindrance to use and difficult to extract information from.<br /> <br /> It is becoming more and more challenging to keep track of all the BI tools that connect and report directly off an organisation’s source systems. These tools are attractive and usually quick to implement. Within a matter of weeks, a CFO can have a dashboard that tells him or her everything there is to know about the organisation’s finances, an operations manager can quickly see the performance of the department, a call-centre manager can understand which agents are performing well and a sales department will have a good representation of how good its sales actually are.<br /> <br /> Whilst these tools work, and they usually work well, there are several fundamentals that need to be in place for these tools to provide an effective solution: accurate and integrated data in the source systems needs to be perfect. If this cannot be guaranteed, a separate level of abstraction is required, and this is achieved through a traditional BI solution.<br /> <br /> It is important to understand the motivation for organisations wanting to implement a BI system. One of the challenges faced by many organisations is calculating the true profitability of a customer, that is how much money the customer actually spends with the organisation, and how much does the cost of sales actually cost the organisation. Costs associated with a customer include the cost of the actual product or service being sold, the commissions paid to the sales people, the organisation’s fixed costs that need to be distributed across all customers and then there are additional variable costs.<br /> <br /> Only once we have done Activity Based Costing and incorporated all fixed and variable costs, can we truly get an accurate reflection of a customer’s profitability. In addition to trying to find out a customer’s true profitability, analysing information to understand inefficiencies in a business is a big motivator. Which of the products are not moving fast enough and therefore costing too much to store? When will the company run out of stock and what are the cross-sell opportunities? Which debtor’s agents are performing and which aren’t? These are all questions that organisations are trying to answer. These are all questions that good a BI solution should be able to provide answers to.<br /> <br /> To successfully implement a BI solution, management needs to understand the disparate systems in their organisation. Instead of trying to go for the quick win, they need to keep their long-term strategy in mind. No one in an organisation should have ‘consolidating data not available in the BI solution’ as part of his or her job description. Before teams try to get dashboards out, they need to understand the underlying systems in the organisation and the Data Supply Chain. Data needs to be 100 per cent accurate and integrated, with sufficient history maintained to enable the discovery of important trends.<br /> <br /> An effective BI solution should be able to drive innovation in your organisation and simplify people’s lives. The purpose of a BI solution is far more than a presentation layer on top of your data. While your organisation is busy trying to impress each other with pie charts, someone else, a more innovative and forward-thinking organisation, is focusing on transforming data into information and letting that information drive innovation.<br /> <br /> Implementing an effective BI solution should not be difficult if you keep the fundamentals in mind and make sure it is not an afterthought. An efficient BI solution will also enable you to create additional service offerings, find new opportunities in the market and validate strategic business decisions.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ryan Naude (Manager: Data Solutions)</strong> <br/><br/> The landscape of Business Intelligence (BI) is shifting. More and more companies are looking for a rapid implementation of a BI solution. While the request to see a return on investment in a solution as quickly as possible is not unfounded, organisations are starting to forget what goes into the foundation of a robust BI solution.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>So you're still running SQL Server 2008?</title>

              <pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2014 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Crucially, it means no more hotfixes, no more cumulative updates and no more service packs. If a bug is identified, it will not be fixed, even if it is a critical bug that severely hinders normal operation. For those businesses running critical operations, this may be unacceptable, and so upgrading to a newer version is clearly the answer.<br /> <br /> The preferred version to upgrade to at this point in time would be SQL Server 2014. There are two main editions: Standard and Enterprise. Standard edition is intended for non-mission critical workloads and small organisations. It lacks many of the scalability and availability features in Enterprise edition. Enterprise edition is aimed at the important workloads where minimising downtime and maximising performance is critical.<br /> <br /> Switching to SQL Server 2014 is not insanely bleeding-edge. With releases now coming every two years now, there are few good reasons to upgrade to an older version. The habit of waiting for SP1 is old fashioned. Service packs are released less frequently and are replaced with more regular and smaller cumulative updates. Of course, staying within support is not the only reason one would upgrade, the features that appear in newer versions are an incentive to upgrade, too. There have been some great enhancements made in SQL Server 2014 that make it worth considering, these include: <ul id="careersList"> <li>Memory-optimised tables</li> <li>Columnstore indexes</li> <li>Buffer pool extension</li> <li>Encrypted backups</li> <li>AlwaysOn for HA/DR</li> </ul> <br /> Memory-optimised tables and Columnstore indexes are two aspects of SQL Server’s in-memory offering – see <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=33889">http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=33889. </a>Memory-optimised tables enable transaction processing at the very highest level and Columnstore indexes allow for incredibly fast analytics.<br /> <br /> The Buffer-pool extension allows both Standard and Enterprise editions to use solid- state devices as if they were memory, offering improved scalability and throughput for both OLTP and reporting workloads.<br /> <br /> While SQL Server has offered compressed backups for multiple versions, encrypted backups have been a long-standing request. With increasing numbers of data thefts and breeches, it is more important than ever to properly protect backups, and that protection starts by encrypting the backup at creation time. This can now be done in SQL Server 2014, in both Standard and Enterprise editions.<br /> <br /> AlwaysOn, available from SQL Server 2012, allows for both high availability and scale-out of reporting workloads with its combination of synchronous and asynchronous replicas. It also allows for the offloading of a backup workload so that the primary server can continue serving the business and customers without interruption.<br /> <br /> Although the end of support for SQL 2008 is drawing nearer, the exciting features available in SQL Server 2012 and 2014, make upgrading a sound proposition.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Gail Shaw (Entelect Technical Lead: SQL Server)</strong> <br/><br/> Mainstream support for both SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 ends in July 2014, so it is important to understand exactly what this means.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Internet of Things – it’s all about the data</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2014 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3> Gathering the data</h3> Crowdsourcing, a term coined in 2005, describes a process used to obtain services, ideas and content by soliciting contributions from a population of people, knowingly or unknowingly, on the part of the participant. The emergence of the Internet has made crowdsourcing a common approach to obtain these services, ideas and content, regardless what the crowdsourcer may use them for. <br /> <br /> There is a vast amount of information that is gathered using crowdsourcing projects, for example: <br /> <ul id="careersList"> <li> Wikipedia is the most popular referenced site on the Internet today, with close to 5 million content pages being maintained by users at an average of 21.78 edits per day and an excess of 732 million page edits since its inception.</li> <li> TripAdvisor, the Internet’s largest travel site, allows potential travellers to plan their journeys by offering trusted advice from people who have been to the place in question. TripAdvisor hosts more than 170 million reviews and opinions on more than 4 million businesses in more than 140,000 destinations.</li> <li> Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) programme enables MVPs to answer millions of questions each year. The MVPS provide vital feedback reflecting the needs of Microsoft customers. MVPs are not paid, instead, they answer questions to share their knowledge with others and for the recognition they receive.</li> <li> Waze, which was recently acquired by Google, allows its 50 million users to share information about daily traffic incidents and situations on roads. This information assists other users in travelling around efficiently.</li> </ul> <br /> It is clear that we are living in an age of Big Data. Crowdsourcing is a very efficient way of gathering information that can be utilised for economic benefit or to benefit communities as a whole and to make our lives easier. The original nature of crowdsourcing is to use willing participants. Those who are can spend time and resources assisting in gathering and submitting information – whatever the crowdsourcer needs. With what some might describe as a revolution of the IoT, all of this has already changed. <br /> <br /> <h3> Possibilities</h3> <br /> Imagine a world where everybody with Internet connectivity has the ability to, with a whole army of their own devices, submit information with minimal effort as frequently as they like or even in real-time and on demand – this is crowdsourcing on a whole new scale! In other words, we could start modelling the world and build an online state model of the world in which we live. This would be possible by making use of and connecting consumer’s everyday devices, leading to a massive explosion of data. <br /> <br /> The data can include almost any type of information, such as weather conditions, ocean currents and wildlife locations. Health information and the tracking of individuals’ medical history can make medical practitioners aware of their patients’ condition and may even assist in warning of conditions before the patient becomes aware of his or her symptoms. The data can also help researchers gain insight into any population or any items’ attributes. This could help us make assumptions and draw correlations between patterns we never even knew existed. Imagine being able to query a model of the world at your convenience. This means you can access information someone or someTHING logged, for example, on the route you might take on holiday or to work. You could access the data for whatever reason you need the specific information… if you can measure it, you can include it. <br /> <br /> <h3> Remote controlling ‘Things’ based on information</h3> <br /> When you can request information from devices in real-time, you can also send commands. This means that we can start controlling devices remotely. We can set up rules in the cloud to perform specific tasks based on our observations of our ‘world model’, which is representing the state of the world. <br /> <br /> <h3> Speaking to everything</h3> <br /> Interaction between devices will mean that they will be able to ‘speak’ to one another, and that devices will have the ability to act and to be controlled based on the state of everything around them – for example, this could mean: <br /> <ul id="careersList"> <li> We could control traffic lights based on specific traffic conditions.</li> <li> We could monitor the health of workers and stop access to hazardous work environments should there be any condition present that endangers a workforce.</li> <li> We could monitor the environments for less-than-ideal conditions.</li> <li> Autonomous cars can use information they obtain from other cars and conditions around them to drive safely without any human intervention – something major players such as Google are already developing.</li> </ul> <br /> Some of these things are already happening but they occur in isolation where integrating all of the data, or at least a platform to allow systems to do their own integration and correlation, can mean decision making and automation processes are much smarter. A whole plethora of possibilities opens up – for example, think about: <br /> <ul id="careersList"> <li> Convenience (home automation, stock-monitoring systems)</li> <li> Safety (warning systems monitoring various factors)</li> <li> Security (online motion sensors, cameras and tracking of items)</li> <li> Controlling devices based on ‘awareness’ of present company</li> <li> Energy and resource usage optimisation (energy monitoring on electronics, effective irrigation control based on conditions)</li> <li> Health monitoring</li> <li> Occupational hygiene monitoring</li> <li> Wildlife preservation (tracking of animals and their vital statistics)</li> </ul> <br /> <h3> Futuristic but already affordable</h3> <br /> There are probably many more ‘futuristic’ uses but the fact is, the technology is already here and it is becoming more and more affordable and less power hungry. It is becoming cheaper and easier to implement. One way is to use the technology that already exists. Waze is already doing this without most of us even realising. Our smartphones and their sensory inputs are being used as ‘Things’ on the Internet. When using Waze, without submitting traffic information manually, you are doing so by just using the application. It will log information with regards to your travel using the sensory inputs on your phone. Smartphones are, in many ways, some of the earliest ‘Things’ on the Internet. <br /> <br /> Companies, including Google, are spending money on mesh networks and are acquiring companies, such as Nest Labs amongst others, to assist with their research and development in this area. Many ways are being researched by big companies and hobbyists to make wireless communications cheaper and less power hungry. Hobbyists can already, with reasonable ease in their own homes, use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE and low frequency RF communications to gather sensory data. Using development platforms such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Beaglebone, these different communication media are being used by hobbyists to relay information and receive commands via the Internet. Fitness-tracking devices are becoming increasingly popular for active people. The traditional fitness computer/fitness watch manufactures have their hands full keeping up with new functionality being made available by a range of new entrants at affordable prices into their market. These are all connected to the Internet in some way, some real-time, others delayed, but they are all examples of ‘Things’ already on the Internet. <br /> <br /> <h3> Barriers to entry</h3> <br /> It is obvious that the obstacles to implementing these futuristic ideas are not technological. Each hobbyist can already create a model of his or her world. There are even products out there that give you access to devices in your home via the Internet. However, this is not where the power of the IoT lies. Individuals using these products would probably be able to control everything in their houses remotely, they can probably sense conditions remotely and can as a result, with some server side processing, set up some rules to automate and manage their world. This is very impressive, but probably also regarded as very ‘geeky’ by most. The true power lies in taking everybody’s small worlds and integrating them into one integrated world on the Internet. <br /> <br /> <h3> Protocols</h3> <br /> The integration medium is already there in the form of the Internet but currently, the problem lies in the protocols used to get the information onto the Internet. Some would argue to use the same protocols as the rest of the Internet but there are difficulties with this. Our ‘Things’ need to be low powered and cheap, therefore we would need lightweight protocols to move information efficiently to a single point on our local network, before passing it onto our traditional Internet. <br /> <br /> At the moment, many protocols exist but we are in the process of seeing which one will emerge as the most used. This is important because consumers would want to, without thinking about it, have their devices or things able to use the same point of access to the Internet and able to talk to each other, or at the least to use each other, as a mesh networking node.<br /> <br /> <h3> Socioeconomics</h3> <br /> Other important questions include: are people ready for this? Will they embrace this change? The chances are that many will feel that this impacts their privacy, and would not want to share information. They believe that ‘if it’s no longer on my premises, I do not have control over who sees it’. This notion, however, seems to be taking a backseat with organisations moving to utilise the benefits of cloud computing. The difference here, is that the IoT, does not only involve organisations but it also includes end consumers. Therefore a similar mind shift – cloud-based computing required from organisations – is required from consumers of these products and devices. <br /> <br /> <h3> Security</h3> <br /> Consumers are scared because they do not comprehend the likelihood, or the impact of risks regarding security. As a result, they also do not understand how to minimise the likelihood of these risks. With privacy being such a major concern, security is important to put device owners in compete control of who can see their data. With no single protocol at the moment being the norm, it is very difficult to have a single way to implement security in such a way, at device level (especially wireless devices) that is trusted to the same degree as the security on the Internet. Also, the impact of security breaches, especially on the remote-control side of devices, may also have a greater impact – imagine cars and access control being hacked. <br /> <br /> <h3> An extension of our Internet</h3> <br /> Adoption of the IoT will probably change our world in such a way that we cannot imagine right now. In essence, it is an extension of our Internet, as we have always known it. However, the IoT can control and read values of real- life things and it can be used to access more information than just what was posted by humans. Suddenly a whole new range of data sources can be made available on the Internet over HTTP and other protocols, and this data will be accessible similarly to how we make information in databases available.<br /> <br /> In the same way the software world moved at an incredible pace, the hardware and embedded world started moving at the same pace with open source prototyping platforms, 3D printers and laser cutters. People are making their projects available open source. Everybody is collaborating and working on new devices, their communications and this ‘new extension’ of our Internet. <br /> <br /> Users should be prepared for a range of new solutions needed in the cloud to support all of the data gathered and innovations resulting from new opportunities made possible by the IoT. Exciting times are ahead and in the same way we converged on a set of standards on the Web, we will converge on a set of standards for the IoT that will integrate with our existing Web standards. <br /> <br /> Cisco estimates that by 2020 we will have more than 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. Some might argue that 50 billion is optimistic but it does give you an idea of the level of belief Cisco has in the IoT growing. Cisco is not alone and companies including Google, IBM, Microsoft, have all made announcements regarding some sort of IoT innovation, and/or shown intention on capitalising on the growth of the IoT. Effectively, the IoT will move us from having smartphones, smartTVs, connected cars, and wearables to having smartcars, smarthomes, smartcities, smartoffices, smartfactories, and other smartenvironments.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Big Data and the Vs</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[After having many discussions about the topic of Big Data with Entelect’s CTO, Martin Naude, I decided to visit my go-to website, Wikipedia, for a ‘tidy’, encyclopedic definition. According to Wiki, the concept of Big Data has been around since 2001. Initially, there were three V's that defined Big Data. These were volume, velocity and variety. However, this is where the main dilemma begins… no one can define any of these V's for me. There is no concise definition of what each one means or entails. So after all the research and more discussions, I have decided to throw the dictionary (and Wiki) out of the window on this one and come up with simpler, more realistic definitions of all the V's and at the same time, hopefully make sense of Big Data.<br /> <br /> While researching the ‘volume’ side of Big Data, I found quite a few definitions. Some say the data must be terabytes, petabytes and even larger. However, ‘volume’ was set as a pillar back in 2001, and when I look back on my career, in the early 2000s if someone had 100 gigabytes of data in a data store, he or she was on the bleeding edge and would probably asked to be a keynote speaker at a conference to explain how he or she actually got it right. Today, we are in a more privileged environment. For just US$3500 we can buy a small footprint hard drive that can store all the music that the world has ever produced. With the uptake of solid state drives, we are able to equip a server that has the ability to store and access tons of data without breaking the bank. So my definition of volume is more around the <em>ability</em> to store and access large volumes of data, and not purely a focus on the amount of data that constitutes Big Data.<br /> <br /> ‘Velocity’ refers to rapidly changing data that is processed at a very quick rate. It won’t come as a shock to find that I have an issue with this one, too! Where is the line in the sand to say we are processing quickly: is it 6 gigabytes a second as in the case of the Large Hadron Collider, is it 1,000 transactions a second or is it once a month? I believe that velocity is less of an important consideration and rather that it is the ability to process, analyse and output the transactions at a required rate over a specific required timeframe. For example, transactional fraud detection is important and we may need near-real-time algorithms to run against the transactions processing, otherwise, our risk exposure would increase dramatically. For geofencing applications we need near-real time, too. However, if we want to analyse a debtors’ book, an acceptable time of a day or two to run certain scenarios and put plans in place for results processing is fine.<br /> <br /> When we look at velocity, we also need to take into account several external factors. These include infrastructure and Internet speeds, storage ability and processing speeds. This is where software meets hardware and fortunately, we are in the middle of a software boom: new data storage engines are being released every month and we now have the likes of Mongo, NewSQL, NoSQL, Hadoop and many more that challenge our preconceptions of storing data in non-traditional formats.<br /> <br /> ‘Variety’ is the one ‘V’ that has really matured over the last ten years. We now have the Internet of Things (IoT) and in sensor-driven manufacturing, we have the ability to pull in social media information to take our understanding of our customer to the next level, and we also have many more lines of business systems that we did ten years ago. This is where the real challenge starts from a Business Intelligence (BI), analytics and Big Data point of view. We can no longer pick a technology and run with it. Historically, organisations were a Microsoft or an Oracle outfit but they are now faced with the challenge of running side-by-side appliances that are appropriate for the relevant variety of data they are attempting to consolidate and relate. Today, organisations need to start diversifying from a single-vendor solution (although I don’t think believe traditional relational database will ever die), to face a new challenge of taking that traditional relational data and relating it to unstructured data (for example, on a Hadoop appliance) and yet still provide the results through a mechanism that business users can understand while remaining intuitive.<br /> <br /> I am not sure what happened in 2012 but another V was added to the list – ‘Veracity’. This means that the data needs to conform to the truth and the data has to be trusted. This, to me, brings everything back together and forms the foundation for a Big Data implementation. In everything we are doing, we need to ensure that what we are providing to business conforms to the truth and can be trusted. If we look up some successful Big Data applications and implementations, we just need to ask the question ‘what if the data was wrong?’ and we will quickly understand the importance of this. When President Obama ran his micro-targeting campaigns, there was very little room for error and the data had to be correct. This is also the case with Amazon.com, which is trialling delivering goods before customers order them. To do this effectively, the company has written such great algorithms to predict what customers are going to order (and when they will order), that if the data is only 90 per cent accurate, the company, stands to lose a lot of money. Then we have Uber, a company that is setting a benchmark for others, innovating in several industries as not just another taxi service. Uber published the algorithm for predicting a client’s destination, and can now begin to offer car-pool services. The value of accurate and correct data is easily understood.<br /> <br /> With all these V’s in place, there seem to be many more marketable V's that can easily be strapped onto the existing foundation. ‘Visualisation’ is important: can we provide business with the information in a format that makes sense? Businesses are spoilt with the number of technologies available to use for a presentation layer. However, this also brings another conundrum – which visualisation tool do they use? And this is where we start balancing cutting edge with bleeding edge. At least once a month, I speak to a potential client who mentions a new visualisation tool and asks if we at Entelect have expertise in it. Each tool has its own pros and cons, and here is where we need to take a step back and define what functionality we are actually looking for in a visualization tool.<br /> <br /> I have done countless implementations where self-service BI was a hard requirement, so the tools were selected and the universe of data provided. Then, however, when I checked in a few months later, the company had employed report writers because they didn’t actually want to write their own reports or their IT department was experiencing headaches because everyone was applying different filters to the data and expecting the same result. Do we actually need interactive charts and graphs, with drill down and drill through, bottom-up and top-down reporting? For many, these requirements are a must, until you mention the price of the potential tool, then they quickly move to a show value first and add the sexy visualisations later. I have never seen a successful revenue assurance implementation run on anything other than raw data. What I am trying to emphasise is that companies need to keep their short-term goals in mind, and before they fork out a lot of money on a visualisation tool, make sure that the path they are going down is going to add value to the business.<br /> <br /> ‘Value’ has also been added to the list of V's. Now that we have all the data and it is available to look at, how do we actually extract value from this? New roles are being created within organisations, for example, we now have chief data officers and the role of the data scientist is also gaining business traction. Once again, before businesses go out and spend money on someone with a quants or risk qualification, they need to look internally for the person I like call the ‘Miss Congeniality’ of your company. This is someone who has been at the company for many years and worked across the majority of the departments. This is the person who best understands the lower levels of the business. He or she is one who understands how the insurance department influences the credit department and the implications thereof. This person will create the foundation before the data scientists arrive.<br /> <br /> In the field of data analytics, many companies have invested in out-of-the-box analytics that will provide a perceived ‘easy way’ to analyse data. It is quick to push out a time series forecast or a decision tree and to cluster the base. This is great, but keep in mind that there is no competitive advantage. Out-of-the-box tools are available to anyone who is willing to pay for them. Know up front that if you want something different, it is going to have to be bespoke.<br /> <br /> So now we have all the theory and the best-case scenario examples. The number of success stories I have read are countless. However, the number I have seen properly implemented are far fewer. We all know the benefits of using this data to drive sales, increase revenue during down times and to engage customers more effectively.<br /> <br /> In South Africa we have access to exactly the same technology as the rest of the world, we have people in this country who are able to create the custom algorithms and to stand up as the true data scientists. The question remains, ‘why are we still behind the curve on this, why are we not the benchmark?’ My pledge to the data community of South Africa is to invest in Big Data competency over the next 12 months and keep you updated each step of the way, I hope to further learn what actually works and what doesn’t, in practical and real-world environments. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, we will be able to position South Africa as the world leaders in Big Data.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why Big Data should be a priority at the moment</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2015 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The reason for the belief in the data age is that as each millionth of a second passes, almost everything we see, hear and touch is generating data. Using PCs, mobile handsets, tablets, GPS devices, servers and sensors attached to vehicles, buildings and satellites, leads to huge amounts of data being stored across multiple databases and data stores worldwide. The speed at which this data is being generated is increasing rapidly and so is the volume and array of different structured and unstructured data types, which are commonly referred to as Big Data. <br /> <br /> In theory, Big Data means having tons and tons of data at your disposal. However, in practice, this data is next to useless if businesses cannot apply analytics to benefit and gain insight from it. Businesses must find a ‘mechanism’ that can perform collaborative filtering to ‘net’ vital information and trends and to answer key questions. <br /> <br /> But, how easy is it to find this mechanism? Currently, there are frameworks that have been developed to store and retrieve the data using MapReduce algorithms. Apache Hadoop is one of the frameworks of choice, and some of the large tech and social media companies have shown a keen interest in it. <br /> <br /> Hadoop is so popular because of the speed at which it can load the volume and variety of data compared with other ETL (extract-transform-load) tools and frameworks. Hadoop can load data much quicker than relational databases because it has no gatekeeping rules. It stores the data on its HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) without needing to match the destination structure with the source structure – a relational database would require ‘Table B’ to be the same as ‘Table A’ in order to transfer data across. Instead, Hadoop stores the data across numerous data nodes using key-value pairs. Initially, querying data on HDFS was slow and involved a great deal of effort. To complete the task, a more SQL-like language was needed. However, over the years, many contributions have been made to this open-source software framework. Currently there are many ‘SQL on Hadoop’ languages, such as Apache Hive, Stinger, Apaches Drill and Spark SQL, which have improved data-retrieval performance considerably. <br /> <br /> Hadoop’s architecture is very scalable so this allows for millions of servers to work together instead of running one high-specced server. Hadoop is also fault tolerant, storing multiple copies of each piece of data in different nodes. If one node goes down, the framework will automatically switch over to another in the most efficient manner. <br /> <br /> In recent times, Hadoop has received a lot of buy-in from the big-player analytics and visualisations vendors. Cloudera is partnering with NoSQL creator MongoDB, and Hortonworks has collaborated with Tableau. Other vendors, such as Qlikview, Spotfire and Microstrategy, have some ODBC configuration to connect to Hadoop. Cloudera has released a universal ODBC driver that enables the connection of many applications, such as Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT), SSIS, IBM DataStage, Ab Initio, Informatica PowerCenter, SAP Data Services, Business Objects, OBIEE, Cognos, SAS, SPSS, Unica, Linked Server, Oracle Database Gateway and many more. <br /> <br /> This all sounds very exciting and convincing that Hadoop is the way to go. However, although Big Data has been around for years, it has still not taken off in the South African market as initially predicted. If you or your company is equipped with skill set similar to these large tech and social media companies, then implementing a Big Data solution is not an issue. However, the question is how many companies are actually equipped with a skill set? The answer is not many and the market is showing a massive demand for Big Data resources. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company has predicted that by the year 2018, the shortfall of Big Data experts will be at anywhere from 140,000 to 190,000. <br /> <br /> The good news is that tertiary institutions are now including Big Data in their curricula and post-graduate degrees, so we can expect the Big Data resource pool to grow over time as these students complete their studies. Until this happens, companies are investing in their current staff compliment to fill the gap. However, learning Big Data via frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop, is quite a steep learning curve compared with traditional, structured BI involving SQL, ETL and OLAP tools, and to a certain degree, it requires a mindset shift. <br /> <br /> Companies do have other options. They can opt for a cloud solution like Microsoft’s HDInsight sitting on their Azure platform. This option has its pros and cons. On the plus side, it collects and stores your data at a reasonable price on your HDInsight cluster. There is no need to understand the background processing and architecture of Hadoop. Microsoft has also developed a way to combine and query both non-relational data (HDInsight) with structured SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse in the form of Polybase. This integrates perfectly with the latest version of Microsoft Excel and an assortment of PowerBI tools, such as PowerPivot and PowerQuery. One of the biggest negatives for this option is the cost involved in processing and retrieving the answers you looking for. There is also the security element of storing sensitive data on an off-site server, perhaps half-way across the globe. Implementing data governance can also be tricky with regard to unstructured data and defining which users are authorised to see which data. <br /> <br /> Another option companies may choose is to engage with consulting companies that have already invested time, research and development in Hadoop and its architecture. Consultancy firms allow their staff autonomy to play around with cutting-edge technologies and often give them carte blanche to find innovative ways of solving tomorrow’s business needs. This allows companies to use this expertise and knowledge without wasting unnecessary time and money. <br /> <br /> Whichever option you choose to invest in, I believe Big Data is the must-have component that should be found in every company’s BI architectural framework. Due to the current skill shortage and reluctance to opt for a cloud solution, Big Data may not be a priority for companies at the moment, but it will definitely become a must in the future. The quicker businesses get their Big Data solution up and running, the faster they will be able to gain a substantial leading edge over their competitors. The race is on for companies to find the answers of tomorrow based on the data that was always there but could never before be analysed.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>My, what Big Data you have!</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Research is critically important and companies need to start asking the right questions before they engage a software supplier. The main objective is to choose a software supplier that will help to grow your business and ultimately, create a mutually beneficial partnership. Choosing the most appealing supplier is a process, and careful considerations need to be made.<br /> <br /> <strong>Adding value</strong><br /> You need to ask yourself which supplier will add the most value to your business and why they will add value. One way to narrow down your selection is to determine each supplier’s main or unique characteristics. Are these characteristics well-matched to your organisation and will they make the supplier the best candidate to handle your Big Data? Does the supplier have a documented procedure for the service it provides and, if so, are its current customers fully satisfied? Another important factor is to make sure your supplier shares your vision for your Big Data outcomes. This is very important as it will ensure all parties are invested from the get go. Often, choosing a local partner has a range of significant benefits, from better and more insightful communication to shorter delivery timeframes. However, for many, distance is not a deterrent and other factors are more important. <div><br /> <strong>More than technology</strong><br /> In choosing your supplier you need to be aware that Big Data is not just a technological problem but a data engineering problem, too – it is not just Hadoop but instead, has many layers and aspects to it. Whoever you choose as your supplier of talent, make sure that the company has a full-circle service offering. This must include analysis, development and data competency. Judging by the current market, it will serve your organisation well to make sure that the supplier is competent in all Cloud platforms because these will be an integral part of your Big Data/Internet of Things solution.</div> <div><br /> <strong>Quality and quantity</strong><br /> Another key indicator is, of course, the quality of the supplier’s service as well as the size and skill set of its staff. You need to ask the supplier about its track record on delivery. The real differentiator is the qualification of the organisation’s staff, its intellectual property and its professional approach to solving complex software problems. If a company really is as BIG as it claims to be, then the proof will be in the data management.</div> <div><br /> One also needs to bear in mind the support structures of the organisation. Are there relevant experts who can be called upon – these experts should range from extremely technically minded employees to those with excellent financial and mathematical skills. </div> <div><br /> Do a bit of research on the supplier’s staff members, too. Do they have blogs and are they actively sharing their knowledge with the development community? This is critical as it will help assess the long-term engagement strategy with the supplier. Again, make sure there are shared values between your organisation and the supplier.</div> <div><br /> <strong>Do you know where they’ve been?</strong><br /> Client referrals are always a must when it comes to reviewing the authenticity of a supplier’s claims. Delve deeper into the supplier’s closet and see if there are any skeletons roaming around. If a client was not fully serviced, it would most definitely be neighbourhood gossip. The converse is true, too: when a client is fully satisfied, the results will be evident in the suppliers' client retention as well as client referrals.</div> <div><br /> Although there is plenty of talent in South Africa when it comes to software engineering, Big Data is such a new concept in South Africa that the tech skills may not be there completely. To this end, organisations should look for a supplier than can plug into all the different aspects of it, including: high-speed data processing, strong data governance and s pedantic and pragmatic approach. Ultimately, who you choose will come down the supplier that ticks all the Big Data boxes that your organisation values most. </div>]]></content:encoded>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, a buzzword emerges out of necessity – there simply is no other way to describe a new phenomenon or trend. In many cases, however, it is a shift in thinking or a reincarnation of an old concept that provides the marketing fraternity with a fresh opportunity to create a ‘buzz’.<br /> <br /> Instead of fostering a real understanding, the use of buzzwords and jargon can create misconceptions that ultimately slow down the decision-making process. At best, people waste time trying to understand what is essentially something very simple. At worst, they miss an opportunity. Either way, new terms can be confusing, so I have decoded some of the IT industry’s up-and-coming jargon and buzzwords.<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Big Data</strong>: <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=39759" target="_blank">Big Data</a> refers to the large amounts of data that are typically collected from events triggered by particular actions or devices monitoring some phenomena, often stored in a loosely structured format. Traditional techniques for processing these large data sets are ineffective and new approaches are necessary to collect, retrieve, summarise and visualise – turning the data into something more meaningful.<br /> <br /> The generally accepted defining properties of Big Data are known as the Three Vs, which Gartner analyst Doug Laney originally coined:? <ul id="careersList"> <li>Volume – the amount of data stored</li> <li>Velocity – the rate at which data is generated and processed</li> <li>Variety – the type and source of the data.</li> </ul> <br /> If each of these properties is increasing significantly, the information can be considered to be Big Data.<br /> <br /> Aside from the fact that companies are collecting vast amounts of information on customers’ movements, behaviour and buying habits, why is Big Data important from a business perspective? The old adage of ‘knowledge is power’ holds true. The more equipped people are to make decisions, the better the outcome for their business. What is relevant in the case of Big Data however, is making sense of the information (separating the noise from the meaningful), the timing of the information, and how to use the information effectively to improve a product or service. The current movement in Big Data aims to address these issues and is reshaping our understanding of how to process information on a much larger scale.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Prescriptive Analytics: </strong>Making sense of the information leads us to the field of data analytics – the tools and techniques that are used to extract meaning from huge volumes of data. Analytics efforts can be broadly classified into one of three main categories – descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.<br /> <br /> Descriptive analytics tells us what has happened and possibly why it has happened. It usually involves reporting on historical data to provide insights into various business metrics. Predictive analytics attempts to tell us what may happen in the future, taking historical data into account and applying algorithms and various statistical models to predict the future.<br /> <br /> Prescriptive analytics, the third and most recent focus area of data analytics, takes it to the next level by recommending a course of action, and presenting the likely outcomes of choosing such action, incorporating any constraints of the current environment (financial or regulatory, for example). An actual person still has to make the decisions but prescriptive analytics can provide valuable input into scenario planning and optimisation exercises, by combining business rules, statistical models and machine learning to quantify the impact of future decisions.<br /> <br /> There is a variety of organisations that have invested significant effort in descriptive analytics and reporting solutions to provide insight into historical data, and many are starting to explore the opportunities that predictive analytics has to offer. Both are necessary precursors to prescriptive analytics, which requires, at a minimum, the capability to capture and summarise large data sets efficiently. The data can then be used as input to prescriptive analytic engines.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Software-defined infrastructure (SDI):</strong> Software-defined infrastructure builds on the capabilities of virtualisation and cloud-based services to define IT infrastructure requirements. These requirements include computing power, as well as network and storage capacity, at the software level. SDI allows application developers to describe their expectations of infrastructure in a standard and systematic way, turning computing resources into logical components that can be provisioned on the fly without human intervention.<br /> <br /> Take today’s scenario of having to configure each element of infrastructure to support an application – machines and images, storage and mount points, firewalls and load balancers to name a few – and replace it with the simple action of identifying an SDI-enabled data centre and clicking ‘deploy’. Each resource is automatically configured as required and, more importantly, can reconfigure itself as the application and usage changes.<br /> <br /> Defining these requirements based on policies and expected usage patterns at the software level and incorporating them into the deployable artefacts, means that IT organisations can respond more quickly to peaks and troughs in throughput and achieve repeatable and reliable application deployments by automating many infrastructure related activities.<br /> <br /> Furthermore, SDI-enabled data centres can optimise resource usage, which will drive down the cost of infrastructure. Specialists can focus on optimising specific elements of the infrastructure, such as network or storage, rather than reactively wiring and rewiring configurations to support evolving application requirements.<br /> <br /> As was the case with Java and the standardised APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that make up the Java Enterprise Edition framework, SDI will require a concerted effort to ensure inter-operability between the tools, platforms and processes that make up the virtual data centres of the future. As with cloud services, there is a vendor battle brewing to capture the lion’s share of what is likely to be a significant market for SDI-capable services. Those vendors who actively drive and support open interfaces and APIs will have the advantage in the long term.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. DevOps:</strong> The term <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=32819" target="_blank">DevOps</a> has been around for some time now and the concept, even longer. However, only in recent years has it started gaining widespread acceptance as standard practice in the development communities. DevOps is to development and operations teams as Agile is to development teams and business. Where the Agile movement promotes increased collaboration between development teams and business users, DevOps looks at integrating operations activities much earlier and more tightly into the software-development life cycle. Both have the same goal of enabling software projects to respond more effectively to change.<br /> <br /> In reality, DevOps is an extension of Agile as we know it today. However, it also includes operations and support functions. The authors of the Agile Manifesto certainly never explicitly excluded operations and support from their widely accepted list of values and principles but in the experience of many, the focus on Agile projects has always been biased towards improving the collaboration between business users and the development team, rather than the development team and the operations team.<br /> <br /> Yes, it is true that the operations team is implicitly included in the concept of cross-functional development teams (see below), but in reality, IT operations in many organisations are still very much an isolated function, which is exactly the barrier that DevOps is trying to eliminate.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Cross-functional teams:</strong> The concept of a cross-functional team is simple. The development team has all the skills necessary to deliver a piece of working software into production, which may include activities such as user experience design, database design, server configuration and, of course, writing code. Where product development teams are concerned, businesses adopting Agile practices should be assembling cross-functional teams.<br /> <br /> This is not an excuse for hiring fewer individuals and expecting them to be Jacks-of-all-trades: specialisation is important and a necessity when solving complex problems that require focus and experience. Having a single, co-located team that can take something from concept to reality, eliminates external dependencies that plague many software development teams of today, especially in large organisations.<br /> <br /> Aside from efficiency and knowledge sharing, the argument for isolated teams defined by skill or technology is the degree of control of standards and governance within a particular domain. This argument is valid but only for operational and ‘commoditised’ services, such as desktop support and hardware infrastructure. As soon as product development enters the mix, the effectiveness of the team becomes more important than the efficiency of the team. Assuming differentiation is one of the main objectives, product development teams should be optimised for effectiveness rather than efficiency, since development in this scenario is a creative process, one that should not be constrained by red tape and corporate IT governance.<br /> <br /> If companies want to increase their chances of creating a product that delights their customers, they should include specialists and designers in the team as full-time members until their services are no longer deemed critical, which will probably be only after several production releases. If you want to minimise your IT costs at the expense of rapid innovation, create a dedicated team that out-sources its services to several internal development teams.<br /> <br /> While the occurrence of new ‘buzzwords’ in the ICT space is on-going, it is crucial that decision makers ensure a practical and simplified understanding before making any kind of investment on behalf of their organisation. Often designed to excite and compel, these buzzwords often do not describe the actual function or benefits of a particular concept. At Entelect, we encourage business leaders to screen potential IT suppliers not by the terminology and complicated jargon they offer, but rather by how simply and understandably they are able to communicate their solutions.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How data lakes can form a culture of innovation</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>While data lakes are becoming more popular, they should not be a tick-box exercise. Effective use of a data lake can provide insights that make significant improvements to your organizational strategy. But, this can only be achieved with the right resources.  Business often talks about having ‘the right people, in the right seats on the bus’, but it’s also about making sure the ride stays interesting. </em></p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">At this year’s Chief Data Officer Forum Africa, the subject of data lakes was a hot topic, as was retaining top talent. But, while businesses become aware of the advantages of data lakes, many do not understand how to leverage them for maximum results. So although, these may seem like separate topics, they are in fact interconnected.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">In the big data environment, many companies are starting to pull away from the traditional approach of Extract Transform Load (ETL) towards Extract Load Transform (ELT). But the emergence of the Data Lake in this shift towards ELT shouldn’t just be viewed as a tick box. In fact, it should be a strategic play to provide your organisation with comprehensive and unique insights to be more competitive.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Once a company appreciates the potential of a data lake, it is in a position to pull incredibly exciting insights. However, to leverage a data lake to its fullest requires a diversity of people and skill sets. In this sense, a culture of innovation that drives continuous learning and collaboration should be considered the ‘best friend’ of exceptional data science.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the topic of data lakes become inextricably linked with attracting and retaining top talent, since extracting insights will be dependent on the capability of the data science team.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Finding a data scientist is tough. In fact, the role is most effectively delivered through two roles, a data engineer and a data analyst. Where a data engineer can populate the data lake and perform the ELT operations, the data analyst can communicate the results to the business in such a way that strategic financial and operational decisions can be made. Consequently, these two roles require different stimulation to sustain high productivity, continuous innovation and ultimately, ensure retention.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Retention therefore, is about making sure the ‘ride stays interesting’. Data engineers and analysts are working in a highly evolving industry so the culture they operate in needs to support this. It requires a strong focus on innovating within roles and structures, which is why the best fit for this industry are environments that create a culture of innovation.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">While big business is under constant pressure to sweat its assets, a consultancy firm has more flexibility to invest in retention strategies such as continual learning and a flexible working environment. Consultancies know that best practices are what differentiate them from their competitors, so these are investments they are willing to make. Similarly, big businesses can be assured of a data science team that is constantly stimulated and in-touch with best practice.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Some ways that outsourced consultancies create a culture of innovation:</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">1.    Consulting companies pride themselves in investing heavily in in-house training programmes that ensure clients are impressed with the skills provided. This serves the dual purpose of improving delivery and keeping the staff continually growing and learning. Staff should be incentivised to attend conferences, get involved in the development community.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">2.    Regarding the work environment for data engineers and analysts, flexibility and freedom will encourage and incentivise the team to come up with new ideas. Providing them with spare time to implement these, whether it be playing around with facial recognition software or thinking of different ways to analyse tweet streams for certain topics, is key to creating a flexible environment.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">3.    Outsourcing is also beneficial to leverage the strengths of the skills effectively. In build phase, a consulting firm can allocate someone who is strong at ELT’s, mainly setting up and optimising the data into the data lake. Once it’s in the data lake, you can bring on the analysts. This ‘roll-on, roll-off’ approach ensures the client always has the best person for the job and means consultancies can be as agile as the client requires.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">4.    Lastly, knowledge transference is critical, because support and maintenance tasks are not for everyone. Transferring the IP back to clients by including them in training sessions, and walking the journey together to build up the internal capacity, means consultancies and clients can both get the most out of the partnership.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">The world of Big Data is changing quickly. I believe that if you are looking to select a partner to accompany you on the journey of implementing a meaningful big data solution, you need to find a company with a culture of innovation that is always looking for new ways to do things, learning new technologies, and staying up-to-date with trends. While the inclusion of a data lake may provide great opportunities for business, a data science team that can adapt to industry culture and remain relevant will keep the ride interesting and provide you with the best results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>SQL 2016 upgrade</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main draw for SQL Server 2016, at least from my point of view, is the Query Store.</p> <p> </p> <p>Query Store allows us to answer the question of how queries were performing in the past, to easily track and fix query performance regressions, to see total resource consumption over time and to identify expensive queries. Previously we would have needed to run Extended Event sessions over periods of time, import the results and aggregate them and then analyse the results, and that’s prone to missing queries if they don’t run all the time. DMVs don’t have that problem, but the data they contain is not persisted, and is lost when the server restarts.</p> <p> </p> <p>Query Store, once it is enabled, captures queries, plans and performance characteristics and persists them into the database. Since it’s persisted and running all the time, we don’t need to worry about whether there was an extended event session running when a query showed a problem, or whether the server has been restarted since the problem started. The data showing historical query performance is a query away.</p> <p> </p> <p>And that’s far from the only feature added in this version.</p> <p> </p> <p>We received temporal tables, tables that automatically keep a history and which are queryable for how the data in the table looked at any point in time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Stretch DB was introduced, the ability to stretch a table into Azure so that cold data can be stored in the cloud, transparently to users.</p> <p> </p> <p>Always Encrypted finally provides an answer to preventing the DBA from seeing data by transparently encrypting the data in the application and storing only encrypted data in the database.</p> <p> </p> <p>Row level security allows users to be assigned rights to read or modify subsets of the data in tables. No more need to add views for security.</p> <p> </p> <p>Live query statistics makes diagnosing current query problems easier, as there’s no need to wait for the query to finish to get the run-time statistics.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are also improvements to Columnstore indexes, In-memory OLTP, Always On Availability Groups and a pile of internal optimisations that make SQL Server 2016 just run faster.</p> <p> </p> <p>But, upgrading is risky, especially with the cardinality estimator changes in SQL Server 2014. Testing for broken functionality isn’t hard if the apps have good test coverage, but testing for performance has been really difficult.</p> <p> </p> <p>Until now with Query Store.</p> <p> </p> <p>Testing performance for the SQL Server 2016 upgrade is as easy as restoring a copy of the DB to a testing server, enabling Query Store, running the workload under old and new compatibility levels, and then using the built-in Query Store reports to identify queries that experienced performance regressions. What could take days of work to identify the regressions in previous versions, can now be done by looking at a single built in report. In some cases, fixing the performance regression may also be easily done with Query Store, using the plan forcing feature.</p> <p> </p> <p>That was the story at RTM, a compelling case for upgrading, and a feature that makes it far easier to test for that upgrade than ever before.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then SP1 was released.</p> <p> </p> <p>The big news of SP1 wasn’t the new features it had, though the features were interesting. The big news of SP1 was about the Enterprise edition-only features, like Columnstore indexes, In-Memory OLTP, Partitioning, Compression and several more.</p> <p> </p> <p>As of SQL Server 2016 SP1, those Enterprise-only programmability features are available in all editions, right down to Express.</p> <p> </p> <p>This makes SQL Server 2016 a must-have upgrade for anyone using Standard edition of any lower version. Upgrade to SQL Server 2016 standard edition, apply SP1 and get a whole pile of features that were previously only available in Enterprise Edition.</p> <p> </p> <p>But there’s more. SP1 also included some nice features itself, including a way to clone a database without data in a single statement, a more flexible hinting model for queries, more DMVs for monitoring what SQL Server is doing and the addition of the CREATE OR ALTER syntax for stored procedures, functions, views, and triggers, which makes deployment scripts simpler.</p> <p> </p> <p>This is one of the best versions of SQL Server in a long time, and upgrading to it should be on almost every IT department’s roadmap for this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Gail Shaw (Entelect: Technical Lead) <br><br> Ever since SQL Server 2016 launched, I’ve been saying that it’s a must-have update for anyone running SQL Server 2012 or below, and an upgrade worth considering even for those running SQL Server 2014. That was before SP1 was released. Now, it’s even more of an essential upgrade.]]></excerpt:encoded>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, the SQLBits conference is held in Telford, a small town near Birmingham and runs from the 5th through to the 8th of April. </p> <p> </p> <p>SQLBits is an excellent conference, small enough to feel cosy, large enough that there are plenty of people to talk tech with. It’s not uncommon to see large groups sitting around discussing various aspects around data, data management or other aspects of the field, even during sessions.</p> <p> </p> <p>The conference is a 4-day event, with full-day seminars running on the Wednesday and Thursday and regular sessions on the Friday and Saturday, with an expected 1500 people attending.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are several must-see sessions this year. This year we have three sessions from Bob Ward, Principal Architect for the Microsoft Data Group, including a look at post-SP! Changes for SQL Server 2016, showing the ongoing work that is going into making SQL Server 2016 even faster and scalable than ever.</p> <p> </p> <p>We also have Conor Cunningham, Principal Software Architect on the SQL Server Query Processor Team, showing off the adaptive query plan feature that’s planned for SQL Server vNext and Azure SQLDB. The adaptive query plan is a complete departure from the way the SQL Server Query Optimiser has worked for many versions, allowing for a single query’s plan to generated in parts as the query executes, and not upfront as is the current behaviour. Conor is also presenting a session on how the engineering team delivers monthly updates to Azure. This is more a practices and methodologies session than a purely technical session, and will be a fascinating look into how the Microsoft teams work.</p> <p> </p> <p>I’m presenting one session this year, a 2-hour dive into indexes on the Friday.</p> <p>In it I’ll be covering index architecture and then looking at how that architecture affects choices for the clustered index. Most of the sessions will be spent looking at how nonclustered indexes are used and how they should be selected to give the best possible improvement to the application performance. I’ll also mention the newer Columnstore, hash and range indexes in SQL Server.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>First Raspberry Pi Jam comes to South Africa</title>

              <pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Willie Strydom was awarded the prize for the most innovative build at the first ever Raspberry Pi Jam to be hosted in South Africa. Willie’s project in ‘home automation’ is designed to consolidate various home automation applications into a single user interface that can be accessed from an app on your iPhone or Apple watch and was selected as the winning entry based on its relevance, usefulness, and future potential. Willie won a ‘Limited Edition’ Raspberry Pi, only 1000 have been produced globally and a voucher to spend at RS Components for his next project.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ‘Raspberry Pi’ is a credit-card-size computer board that can run the same basic functions as a PC but costs a fraction of the price. The device has been used in numerous applications from setting up computer labs to home automation, and from atmospheric monitoring to robot cars.  A Raspberry Pi Jam is an organised community event where people get together and share knowledge, learn new things and meet other Raspberry Pi enthusiasts. This particular event was structured as a show and tell, meaning that participants were given the opportunity to demonstrate their Pi projects and discuss them with other like-minded Pi enthusiasts.</p> <p> </p> <p>Jointly hosted by RS Components and Entelect Software, nine Pi projects were presented and the event kicked off with a keynote address by Eben Upton, the illustrious inventor of the Raspberry Pi.</p> <p> </p> <p>Upton’s address, provided the guests with an insight into the initial concept of the Pi and the start-up phase of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. He explained that the idea of the Raspberry Pi came about in trying to solve a particular problem which was to boost an interest in computer programming and STEM learning in young learners. The concept was to create an affordable computer at $35, which needed to be both functional and simple enough for a child to learn coding. The team initially envisioned selling 1000 Raspberry Pi boards, but demand peaked quite rapidly to 10 000 boards and 5 years later they have sold over 15 million units around the world.</p> <p> </p> <p>During the event, RS Components and Entelect Software representatives shared their expert knowledge with the participants to provide some insight on where to next with each of the projects presented. Projects were judged by a panel according to predetermined criteria, such as, novelty, creativity, technology choices, user experience, simplicity and future potential.</p> <p> </p> <p>Second place went to Gareth Stephenson, who presented his ‘Pi Cluster’ project which tested the concept of cluster computing using Raspberry Pis.</p> <p> </p> <p>Third place went to: Schalk van Heerden with his ‘Cherry Pi Brewery’ project which is a prototype concept for a fully automated micro-brewery.</p> <p> </p> <p>Other notable projects were:</p> <p>A self-driving car, developed by Philip Booysen.</p> <p>An offline library developed for underprivileged students, designed by Yoshiaki Nagasawa, a Japanese student, currently living in Cape Town.</p> <p> </p> <p>Explaining where the idea came from to host the first Raspberry Jam in South Africa, Brian Andrew, General Manager, RS Components South Africa, said: “Since the day the Raspberry Pi was launched in South Africa in 2012, it was an instant hit with design engineers, makers and anyone who loves tech gadgets because of its cost and the fact that it functions as a mini computer. Although it was initially designed to promote STEM learning and coding, it has successfully been used in both business and home applications. We realised that as a global distributor of the Pi computer board, we needed to initiate a platform in South Africa for Pi fanatics to get together and share their knowledge and ideas.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Mark Beets, General Manager at Entelect Software, agreed: “We’re passionate about the future of technology and, for us, this means doing whatever we can to help the tech community grow, and creating environments where people can share their innovations with like-minded people. The Raspberry Pi is an awesome tool that enables tech enthusiasts to create some really cool innovations, which is exactly what we saw today.”    </p> <p> </p> <p>Although the date for the next Raspberry Pi Jam hasn’t been set yet, there are plans in the pipeline. Both Andrew and Beets agree that these community platforms are where some of the best innovations happen, so watch this space.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you would like to be informed about future Raspberry Pi Jams, please register on the following link: <a href="http://bit.ly/RPiJamSA">http://bit.ly/RPiJamSA</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How the blockchain can put an end to identity theft</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You and I could be among the 30 million South Africans whose personal information was compromised in the <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=165695">country’s largest data breach</a> to date. Look at that number again: 30 million – more than half of the country’s population. Actually, the security researcher who exposed the breach – let’s call them the Hunt Files, after the researcher – expects this number to be a lot higher. It’s a very real possibility that our information is on that list: our ID numbers, names, addresses, genders, birth dates, ethnicities, occupations, marital status and more.</p><br> <p><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Greatest threat</span></strong></p><br> <p>The hack has brought cybersecurity into the spotlight once again. South Africa has the <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/industrynews/219598-cyber-theft-the-fastest-growing-crime-around-the-globe.html">third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide</a> and loses more than R2.2 billion to internet fraud and phishing attacks annually, according to the South African Banking Risk Information Centre. Gartner predicts that cybercrime might become the greatest threat to every person, place and thing in the world within the next five years.</p><br> <p>Clearly, something has to change.</p><br> <p>Enter the blockchain, a shared, digital, decentralised, secure online ledger that facilitates online transactions – and not just monetary ones. Had the Hunt Files been stored on the blockchain, the hack would never have happened.</p><br> <p>Here’s why:</p><br> <p><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Decentralised</span></strong></p><br> <p>The Hunt Files were stored on a central database with questionable security, which is why it was possible to access all the information easily and in one go.</p><br> <p>The blockchain is stored on a decentralised database – the blockchain, comprising thousands – if not hundreds of thousands – of nodes, scattered all over the world. An attacker will need to control more than 51% of the nodes in order to compromise the database, and the chance of that happening is virtually impossible.</p><br> <p><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Secure</span></strong></p><br> <p>The blockchain uses public-key cryptography, which is one of the strongest form of encryptions available today. It’s used to secure websites, certificates and just about everything on the Internet. Together with the decentralised nature of the blockchain, this means that not even the combined power of the world’s supercomputers could crack the chain. It has stood the test of time for the past nine years, securing hundreds of billions of dollars</p><br> <p>Without the blockchain, our data is “owned” by hundreds of different service providers – banks, telcos, e-commerce stores and more. This means our information is stored on potentially thousands of different databases that, hopefully, have robust security in place. Clearly, some don’t.</p><br> <p><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Power shift</span></strong></p><br> <p>With the blockchain – and with apps like <a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic</a> – consumers regain control of their data. They decide who can access it, for what purposes and for how long. And, when we no longer need the service (e.g. we switch banks), we take our information with us, rather than leaving a copy of it on the bank’s database.</p><br> <p>Civic makes it as easy to log into a website as it is to log in with Facebook, except our information is stored on our phones and not in a public database. When we log in with Civic, we scan a barcode on the website that allows the site to only access the bare minimum information. If it only needs our email address to log in, that’s all it gets. If we were to log in with Facebook, we share a lot more about ourselves than the site needs to know – like personal information, interests and connections.</p><br> <p>From next year, Civic will be able to process Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) requests, making it a viable option for quick, cheap and secure compliance and regulatory verifications.</p><br> <p><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Challenges</span></strong></p><br> <p>The biggest challenge hampering the wide scale uptake of the blockchain is throughput. The fastest blockchain platforms currently available can process around 1,000 transactions a second. When we first started using blockchain for transaction processing, it could only handle around seven transactions – making it ideal for the processing of cryptocurrency transactions at the time.</p><br> <p>While we’ve come a long way in a short space of time, we’re still far from the 40,000 transactions processed every second by the likes of Visa and Mastercard. But at the current rate of development, we anticipate serious contenders by the end of 2018.</p><br> <p><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Start now, start here</span></strong></p><br> <p>Many people still believe that the blockchain only has financial applications. But because of the reduced cost and ease of developing decentralised apps (Dapps), we’re already seeing a lot more use cases, across every industry, including government, healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain and identify verification.</p><br> <p>Like the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the blockchain is going to radically change many industries, and now is as good a time as any for businesses to start exploring its use cases and opportunities – especially if they’re still running their operations on legacy infrastructure.</p><br> <p>Before embarking on a blockchain project, ensure your team has the skills to develop Dapps and that they understand cryptography. Chances are, if you handle any kind of sensitive information, the blockchain will provide an unmatched level of security and user control, helping you to meet governance requirements and to gain the trust of your customers.</p><br> <p>The blockchain is going to fundamentally challenge traditional power structures by giving control of information back to the consumer. Innovating in this space is a business’ best defence mechanism. If businesses don’t embrace the blockchain, they may very likely have their own Kodak moment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>What will the skills base of the future look like?</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The workforce of the future is going to be dependent on its adaptability. While it’s true that many jobs of today will no longer exist, in the short term, one should worry less about the relevance of a current job and rather focus on priming the next generation to follow careers that meet the needs of the technology revolution.</p> <p> </p> <p>In today’s job market, many jobs include manual labour, tedious repetition of tasks, or basic decision-making, all of which are prime for replacement via automation or artificial intelligence. This is because a machine will almost always be better in performance at jobs of this nature. Equally however, with the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, jobs involving architecting systems, and systems maintenance, will become more important.  People are also required to have a deep understanding of domains, the ability to make strategic decisions, and translate a strategy into something that machines can understand and can work towards. So, these roles will remain crucial.</p> <p> </p> <p>While it’s difficult to name explicit jobs of the future, some essential skills will be required:<br />  </p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">• IT and domain-based skills. The ability to understand intricacies in different domains is important to ensure that the technology we build to address problems is suitable.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">• Communication skills are vital in translating ideas and a strategic vision to something tangible.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">• The ability to apply logic, as well as strong problem-solving abilities, are needed to design, engineer, and bring these technologies to life.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Creativity is also something difficult to simulate in a machine. The ideation of possibilities whilst simultaneously considering the impacts of it is a complex thought-process which is difficult to simulate in a machine.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, a study conducted by Ad agency, McCann, in Japan, pitched its creative planner to the world’s first AI creative director to develop a TV commercial. In an anonymous vote the AI creative director’s TV Ad won, using only algorithms to respond to the brief and determine the elements of the TV Ad. However, in creative scenarios such as this, the algorithms will be created by humans, so arguably, people remain at the heart of AI’s efficacy and humans with these skills remain important for the future.</p> <p> </p> <p>This concept, of technology replacing the human mind, is a definite possibility in the distant future. We may be able to upload our minds to machines, we may develop algorithms that learn how to think generally like humans do. There are many examples of early stages of general intelligence technology today such as Google’s Alpha Go. Currently, we are harnessing automation and artificial intelligence to tackle narrow domains and contexts. As we get better at building these systems, a more general intelligence similar to the human mind becomes more realistic. </p> <p> </p> <p>In the longer term, individuals who want to remain relevant and an asset to their organisation need to undergo a mind shift. Fundamentally, it all comes down to one thing: Innovation and future thinking.</p> <p> </p> <p>By being open to change and harnessing it for the benefit of the organisation, every person can be an asset. Being stuck in a traditional way of thinking and doing things quickly becomes a hindrance to innovation. Often, an organisation can operate fine, unaware of its sloth, until it’s disrupted by another organisation that embraces innovation. By that time, it’s too late. Companies need to invest in skunk works, or at least the culture that encourages people to innovate from within because organisations also have a role to play in developing the skills of the future.</p> <p> </p> <p>Being open to rethinking the way we work, the value we add, and the vision we work towards is almost expected for the future of an organisation. Be part of the revolution, or be consumed by it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Pair-programming makes light(er) work of sprint zero</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Kale-Ab Tessera (Entelect, Intermediate Software Engineer)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Software Engineers are notorious for being antisocial. We are known to work in isolation, with our headphones on and enough coffee and snacks to sustain us. However, with the increased adoption of Agile and Extreme Programming, pair programming has increased in popularity, challenging the lone-programmer mindset.</p> <p> </p> <p>My team and I were challenged to deliver an MVP in 16 weeks for a large South African mobile communications company. The challenges included a tight timeline, high-quality delivery, acute and effective problem-solving and somewhere amongst all this, team growth.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sprint zero is often the hardest – in order to develop a MVP, teams have to conduct client interviews, story mapping with UX designs, setup of the delivery pipeline for the squad, continuous Integration and delivery, deployments, identifying and implementing communication channels such as Slack, with integrations into the delivery pipeline. </p> <p> </p> <p>Essentially, pair programming is where two people simultaneously working together on the same piece of code. One person (the driver) codes, while another person (the navigator) makes suggestions, corrections and improvements to the code written. These two roles can also switch at certain intervals allowing both individuals to get a chance at coding and, making suggestions.</p> <p> </p> <p>We believed pair-programming would help overcome key challenges synonymous with ‘sprint zero’, such as distribution of knowledge, code quality, and team communication, but we uncovered some other benefits along the way too.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Adopting new technology and acquiring new skills</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>On this project, many of the team were new to React and Spring Boot. Pair programming allowed us to learn and rapidly distribute our knowledge in the team. Once someone had learned how a part of a framework works, he/she would pair with an individual who didn’t and this would quickly distribute the knowledge in the team, meaning in a few weeks, we all knew the fundamentals of the frameworks we were using.</p> <p> </p> <p>Along with quick distribution of knowledge, this approach also reduces key man dependency, whereby only one individual knows how a certain part of a system works. Pair programming transforms the effectiveness of the entire team by ensuring at least two people have seen or worked through each part of the system. Distribution of knowledge also supports the development of high-quality code under tight deadlines.</p> <p> </p> <p>Another advantage we had as a result of pair programming was increased project momentum. We have all been in situations where we have spent too much time stuck on a technical task. Rather than asking a coworker for help, we tend to push through and waste valuable time. Pair programming ensures that if one person is stuck or struggling, another person is able to help or is at least aware of the situation.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Maintaining code quality</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Sixteen weeks is a tight deadline for any team to develop a MVP and makes achieving good code quality quite difficult. In addition to Unit, Integration and Acceptance Tests, pair programming allowed us to ensure quality was maintained as we coded in pairs and checked each other’s code and logic.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is inevitable that having multiple people working on the same piece of code, increases the likelihood to pick up bugs earlier, while decreases the chance of using obscure hacks (two people need to agree to these hacks).</p> <p> </p> <p>Furthermore, both parties can share their knowledge, tips and tricks with one another, creating a code base using the shared knowledge of both parties. Even the intern could teach you about some design pattern or tool he or she read about the night before.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Team communication</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Effective team communication is a critical part of any successful project. Pair programming encourages individuals to discuss problems together and solve them in a way that both parties are happy. This also ensures a better spread of knowledge of what is going on in the system, ensuring that more people are in the loop with the inner working of the system and what the business requires.</p> <p> </p> <p>This was especially relevant to our project, as it had complicated business rules, which the team needed to master quickly. When pairing, we would spread and build on our understanding of these complicated rules and we could discuss possible ways of representing these rules.</p> <p> </p> <p>Working in tight-knit pairs and communicating closely also helps keep the teams focused. We found that it is much easier for a pair to stay highly focused for longer, than a larger team where people work as individuals and some people on the periphery fade away.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>A perfect solution?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Naturally,  there are risks too. The most significant risk with pair-programming that we have identified is slower development time. Research has shown that pair programming has a 15% development time cost (https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF). This is because less tasks can be worked on concurrently. Additionally, whether it is due to different experience, skill levels or just programming speed, pair programming can also slow down the faster of the pair.</p> <p> </p> <p>Additionally, Pair programming inherently involves a lot of discussion, but it is important to ensure majority of this talk is related to tackling the issues at hand. A major risk of pair programming, is having one person doing all the work or driving, while the other individual is disinterested or on their phones. This could lead to a wasted resource and no real value received from pair programming.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we know that some engineers prefer working alone, so Pair Programming will be a big shift for some team members.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Undeniably, Pair Programming is an investment</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Even with the possible risks of slightly slower development times, workload imbalance or off topic discussions, pair programming can increase quality of code and ultimately saves time and money.</p> <p> </p> <p>Pair programming should definitely be viewed as an investment. The longer-term advantages of distribution of knowledge, code quality and bug fixes, along with team communication and problem-solving capabilities, converts a 15% development time cost, into an investment in the present and future capabilities of any team. </p> <p> </p> <p>Teams still need to have the discipline and the people skills to make sure pair programming is beneficial. In situations where pair programming is not possible, teams could ensure thorough code reviews are done so that all code has been checked or at least seen by more than one person.</p> <p> </p> <p>Is pair programming suited for your team? Well, maybe. It worked well for our team and allowed us to build a good quality MVP, with majority of the team having a good idea of the system as a whole. Why not give it a try?</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Cut through the hype: How to find value in AI</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2019 8:23:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CuttingthroughthehypeofAI-06.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has erupted as an industry trend over the last two years, with a clear confusion about what AI really means to us as consumers and businesses. Are robots coming for all of our jobs? Do we have to prepare for the rise of the machines?</p> <p><br /> I think a key challenge we face, especially as technology experts in industry right now, is to demystify AI for our customers and partners. AI is not a single technology, but rather a number of different technologies applied in different functions through various applications. We need to separate applications of it into layman’s terms, being careful not to follow the rabbit hole with wild ideas, costing lots and changing little.</p> <p><br /> Looking at the recent Gartner hype cycle, their research indicates that many of the applications of AI will be rounding the top of their hype cycle imminently (excluding general intelligence, which is an entirely different concept.)</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/hypecycleR.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>This means there is a small window of opportunity remaining to leverage the AI buzz with executives, customers and other stakeholders before it slips into the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’, making justification for new projects very difficult.</p> <p><br /> So if AI isn’t this magic potion which turns every product into a runaway success, how does one even begin to clarify which ideas within AI have real merit and long-term potential as a new product or upliftment to your business?</p> <p><br /> Employ a pragmatic approach to compare the flawed ideas from the differentiators with value. Consider the following when preparing for your next AI-inclusive software project:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Leverage AI within strategic initiatives: What are the big ticket items in the organisational strategy? This is where any AI solution should be explored. Don’t lose focus on the mission critical priorities just to introduce AI as a side-line initiative.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Understand how the given AI solution will solve a specific challenge: It’s easy to get lost in the case studies and magic marketing, especially from the big players. But ensure there is a set objective which can and will be met.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Be critical when weighing up solutions with and without AI: Consider whether there is any material benefit to justify the costs. You might find that a ‘simple’, non-AI solution solves the problem without any fuss.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Have evaluations in place: Ensure you are clear about success criteria, and have specific and measurable outcomes in place for the AI components. The benefits of the AI solution should be measurable against the criteria and it should be evident that the product owner isn’t only using AI for the sake of it.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Spend time on understanding the AI solution: It is important for businesses to note that the product will be radically different from their usual technological enhancements. Product owners should take the time to research and understand the AI solution, which will enable them to make informed decisions.</li> </ul> <p><br /> Whether creating new digital experiences for clients, more accurate predictions, or innovative ways to interact, AI is already changing the face of industries and should be utilised.</p> <p><br /> Ultimately, as a participant in the global technology industry, at Entelect we have a responsibility to help our clients and partners cut through the hype, and find real and impactful applications of AI which can make it into production.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Do you need a blockchain for that?</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 15:27:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DoyouneedablockchainforthatProbablynot-11.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/BlockchaindictionaryentryResized.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>We’ve heard all about the amazing ways blockchain is going to revolutionise lives and industries – by making supply chain more reliable, banking transactions faster, commodities trading cheaper, and politics more transparent and efficient. There were even questions about why South Africa isn’t using blockchain to safeguard our votes after the recent alleged double-voting controversy during our 2019 general elections. So, if blockchain seemingly has the ability to change everything for the better, why is everyone not using it?</p> <p> </p> <p>The short answer – because most systems don’t actually need blockchain, and people often just use it for the sake of it. There is a widely ridiculed use case of an American salad-serving restaurant chain said to use blockchain in their food supply tracking, even announcing that they were “the first to use blockchain as an application for food.” If you’re wondering why they were criticised for using blockchain in their supply chain, it’s because there were multiple easier, cheaper, more effective alternatives. This is a prime use case of using blockchain for the sake of it and not leveraging what the distributed ledger actually offers.</p> <p> </p> <p>Taking a step back to the blockchain-in-voting topic, it’s important to note that blockchain is not immune to security threats. Even though South Africa definitely does need a more secure alternative to our current paper-ballot voting method, blockchain isn’t it. West Virginia announced that they would be the first US state to experiment with blockchain during their midterm elections, allowing people serving in the military to vote via a smartphone app. But experts in both cybersecurity and voting see blockchains as needlessly complicated, and no more secure than other online ballots.</p> <p> </p> <p>Blockchain would work for recording votes, but would need additional layers of technology for more complex challenges such as voter validation, ballot anonymity, and letting voters verify whether their votes were recorded.</p> <p> </p> <p>The final results would be stored on the blockchain so you can have a permanent record of the final result, but this does not guarantee that the votes hadn’t been altered before they went on the blockchain. Simply put, blockchain would not solve the double-voting problem.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are many organisations looking to use blockchain technology to build products which don’t need blockchain, gain nothing from it, and in some cases are worse off because of it. To help you, we’re sharing some of our experiences.</p> <p> </p> <p>The below flowchart has a list of questions you need to ask before using blockchain to ensure your product needs and benefits from the technology:</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Blockchainflowdiagram.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Looking at this, the salad restaurant chain wouldn’t have made it past the first question, and secure voting has major problems at the last three, as well as a technical weakness just getting votes into the blockchain to start with.</p> <p> </p> <p>Blockchain is no silver bullet and more often than not, there is a simpler alternative. It’s easy to be wooed by the latest trending technologies promising industry disruption, but you need to think critically about how the technology would help you. A useful rule of thumb is to always determine which distinct advantages the new technology brings with it, along with the problems. Overlooking a potential technology mismatch in a rush to get a solution out is a sure way to end up over invested in a product which isn’t actually fit for purpose.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>4 ways to future-proof your IoT solution, and avoid obsolescence.</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:36:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/4waystofuture-proofyourIoTSolution-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving rapidly and it’s difficult to say what things may look like in a year or two, much less in the next decade. One of the biggest concerns for organisations is buying what soon becomes functionally or technologically obsolete, but continually deferring to invest in IoT could lead to analysis paralysis.</p> <p> </p> <p>Organisations understanding the use cases and potential of IoT are the organisations that will likely drive innovation over the next decade. IoT is enabling businesses in numerous industries to prevail – especially industries you would not typically associate with this technology. Manufacturing plants are using machine learning and smart sensors in their manufacturing process, farmers are using IoT to meet growing agricultural demands, and oil and gas companies use IoT devices to optimise drilling procedures.</p> <p> </p> <p>The below graph showcases the worldwide IoT spend per industry in 2015, as well as the predicted spend for 2020.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/IoTGraphFinal.png" style="width: 800px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The biggest spenders over the last few years have been the manufacturing and logistics industries, due to the fact that the industrial world comes with decades of legacy equipment and existing infrastructure that cannot be replaced easily or cost effectively. After dealing with the replacement and integration of legacy systems, how are these industries ensuring successful IoT adoption while still avoiding obsolescence?</p> <p> </p> <p>Unlike more established technologies, the immature and fast-evolving nature of IoT solutions increases the risk of early obsolescence. In the age of IoT cloud-based solutions, future-proofing is a continuous process to maximise solution adaptability, while still managing risk.</p> <p> </p> <p>Below are four considerations to keep in mind to ensure a future-proofed IoT landscape.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1.    Security<br /> Masses of data means masses of potential security threats</strong><br /> There’s a quip that goes: The ‘S’ in IoT stands for ‘security’. This is because IoT adoption is widely criticised for the lack of security. Having an IoT solution that does not start with security as first priority – addressing authentication, authorisation, and encryption of data – will not only lead to obsolescence, but will also risk putting the entire solution at risk. Future-proofing your IoT security will ensure that customers’ personal details don’t get leaked.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2.    Scalability<br /> IoT solutions should be based on horizontally scaling architectures</strong><br /> With the IoT wave growing quicker than expected, there has not only been an increase in devices, but also an increase in the amount of data that is being transferred. There are many considerations that go into building up an IoT infrastructure that can scale, but there’s a lot more to consider than simply scaling servers. Designing an infrastructure that can scale will help ensure the success of the business that is built upon it.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.    Flexibility<br /> Rapidly adopt new devices, protocols and integration</strong><br /> As more IoT applications emerge, architectures need to be flexible enough to adapt to varying requirements and feature sets. There will undoubtably be new devices entering your ecosystem and your IoT solution must be prepared to handle those devices. A lack of flexibility will result in the rapid aging and obsolescence of your system.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4.    Portability<br /> A single deployment model is not enough</strong><br /> The universal shift to the cloud is challenging for many large enterprises. For those looking to build future-proof IoT, leveraging cloud-based technologies and the application of real-time data analysis can enable autonomous decision-making, and create the potential for new services and revenue streams.</p> <p> </p> <p>Fortunately, the frameworks provided by major technology players have recently matured. The Platform-as-a-Service offerings from Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apache are now truly production ready. They have a large amount of infrastructure, data and network heavy-lifting available out the box, and pre-configured solutions available for other areas in some instances. There are essentially fewer breaking changes which would affect your product, so there has never been a better time to pursue an IoT solution.</p> <p> </p> <p>Future-proofing your IoT infrastructure is achievable as long as your organisation is thoroughly prepared for the changes that IoT brings, or you have an expert technology partner who can guide you through these four critical aspects.</p> <p><br /> Entelect is an end-to-end technology services provider delivering custom software across all industry sectors. Entelect has developed several large IoT enterprise solutions, leveraging modern cloud infrastructure to ensure future-proofing.</p> <p> </p> <p>Find us at: <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za">www.entelect.co.za </a>/ <a href="mailto:solutions@entelect.co.za">solutions@entelect.co.za</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>A look at feature stores to enable machine learning</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 8:06:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Alookatfeaturestorestoenablemachinelearning-FINAL1.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Working with data is messy and getting it ready for any kind of model building is a painstaking and time-consuming process. Building feature stores is meant to optimize this process for all machine learning teams in an organization.<br /> <br /> The concept of a feature store is growing in popularity with Uber introducing the concept in 2017 as part of the data management layer in their machine learning platform, Michelangelo. Netflix used a similar concept called a feature encoder in their time machine, Delorean. Other companies embracing feature stores include Linkedin and Airbnb.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What is a feature store?</strong></p> <p><br /> A feature store is a curated collection of pre-computed features, stored in a centralized location. Features are calculated by joining raw data sources and transforming them into formats that can be interpreted by machine learning models. They are then stored under descriptive names in a central location, making them identifiable and accessible to the teams using them.</p> <p><br /> In addition to storing the features, the feature store has the functionality to continuously update the feature calculations as new data is added and track that data lineage. They also have the functionality to create new features and backfill them using the historical data.</p> <p><br /> <strong>But what is it for?</strong></p> <p><br /> Data scientists at Airbnb spend up to 60% of their time engineering features to be used for machine learning and Uber says during model training the most time is spent transforming and selecting features. Creating these features is a fundamental part of the machine learning workflow but also a an inefficient one.</p> <p><br /> Feature stores solve several problems in the machine learning workflow:</p> <p><br /> 1. If features are calculated ad-hoc as part of the pipeline, they are difficult to reuse across different pipelines. This wastes time and resources during the experimentation phase. Feature stores standardize how features are accessed and make them reusable across pipelines and teams.</p> <p><br /> 2. It allows teams to share insights by including new features that they have found useful in the store.</p> <p><br /> 3. Feature stores also create a consistency in data. Various teams may unknowingly be creating the same features, a waste of resources but also various implementations may produce different results obscuring the definition and understanding of the feature to the teams and the company.</p> <p><br /> 4. Features are automatically updated when new data comes in, but the data lineage is tracked. This way teams do not have to redo all the calculations to update their features, but they can still replicate experiments from before data updates occur. This is important for explaining model decisions and tracking model performance over time.</p> <p><br /> 5. Features calculated during the experimentation phase in the data scientists preferred language may not be perfectly replicable in the production system. This causes an inconsistency in the features used for training and those calculated for live predictions. Performance of a model is then difficult to measure accurately until it is deployed, which can be a costly mistake.</p> <p><br /> The feature store makes it possible for teams to search through a catalogue of features for what they need. Teams can gain insight from other teams by browsing the existing features or sharing their own when they add new ones. The time saved on feature engineering can then be dedicated to model building. Since this is a very experimental process, the time added to the model building phase allows more ideas to be tested and a better solution built.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Off-the-shelf or custom-built?</strong></p> <p><br /> Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb have all created their own custom feature store implementations. Since these companies were at the forefront, they did not have an off-the-shelf solution available to them. However, not every company needs a completely custom-built option and now there are off-the-shelf options available. Open-source feature store services are available from Hopsworks and Feast with Airbnb planning to open source their solution, Zipline, in the future.</p> <p><br /> Building a reliable, speedy feature store could be a massive undertaking as it will need to malleable enough to create new features and backfill them, produce the results in a reasonable amount of time and be queryable from multiple platforms and finally be accessible to both offline sandboxes and online deployed models.</p> <p><br /> Off-the-shelf options are faster to get up and running and will show return on investment sooner, but they are still quite new and there isn’t feedback yet on how they are doing within organisations that have adopted them.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Want to read more?</strong></p> <p>Feature Store: the missing data layer in ML pipelines?:<a href="http://https://www.logicalclocks.com/feature-store/" target="_blank"> https://www.logicalclocks.com/feature-store/</a><br /> Introducing Feast:<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-feast-5eb4d539c13f"> https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-feast-5eb4d539c13f</a><br /> Meet Michelangelo: Uber’s Machine Learning Platform: <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/">https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/</a><br /> Distributed Time Travel for Feature Generation: <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/">https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/distributed-time-travel-for-feature-generation-389cccdd3907</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How to create the right DevOps culture in your organisation</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 11:18:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DevOpsCultureArtwork-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>DevOps is a cultural shift. It’s not a matter of simply adopting agile planning or continuous delivery, although those practices are certainly important. Creating a DevOps culture in your organisation is about having shared understanding, communication and collaboration between software engineers and operations, and sharing responsibility for the software they build.</p> <p> </p> <p>Creating such an environment is a challenge. It requires assessing and realigning how people think about their teams, the business, and the customers. People don’t often welcome change, but it is doable by following these four steps to developing a strong and effective DevOps culture in your organisation.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1.    Get leadership on board</strong><br /> Ensuring you have management buy-in is the first step. Without it everything else will fail. Bringing DevOps into your organisation involves cultural changes that are usually more difficult for management to adapt to than staff. Taking a DevOps approach requires being comfortable working more transparently and requires management to be comfortable with seeing certain team failures as growth opportunities. A top-down approach to initiating a DevOps culture is the ideal way to ensure that teams experience smooth integration.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2.    Start simple</strong><br /> As with adopting any new practices, it’s important not to overwhelm teams with sudden, unmanageable changes. Explore the DevOps process with a viable pilot project and constantly field feedback from team members along the way. This will allow you to encourage collaboration between teams and introduce reliable measurements to frequently improve before rolling it out to bigger projects.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.    Use DevOps to create a culture of growth</strong><br /> Implementing a DevOps culture is an opportunity to grow team members, expand skillsets and expand responsibilities. Ensuring end-to-end responsibility for products is essential in an integrated team environment. This will allow software engineers to not just do repetitive coding, but to take more accountability for the whole solution including infrastructure, support and tooling.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4.    Break down silos</strong><br /> Encourage forming horizontal connections in your company to break down silos, and increase transparency, communication and collaboration across teams. Discussions between teams lead to valuable insights and inputs into the development process, allowing teams to avoid certain issues and inefficiencies right from the get-go. Great software is built by great teams, which are built on great relationships. It drives down response times and pushes sprint velocity (and talent retention) up.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DevOpsDiagram.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Teams who get DevOps right have done so on the back of a strong, reliable culture, driving them to take accountability and ownership of the end product. This culture has to be supported by managers who are willing to learn alongside their teams. Software Engineers should feel comfortable to reach outside of the “develop” step of the SDLC and across into other areas like design, testing, configuration, infrastructure and deployment. Mixing these roles and responsibilities promotes the shared accountability that a successful DevOps culture requires.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Understanding bias in artificial intelligence</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/AIbias.png" /></strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to learn how to do things that people are good at. Humans are great at stringing together complex concepts and harnessing them towards a goal. With that in mind, we’re also moulded by our culture, upbringing, and history. This introduces bias in all humans.</p> <p> </p> <p>AI systems are only as good as the data we use to mould them. This all stems from people deciding what data is captured, how it is captured, and to an extent, how it is interpreted. With the upsurge of AI in human-centric areas, such as hiring, finance, and criminal justice, society has started to wrestle with just how much human biases can make their way into these systems.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How AI bias happens</strong><br /> Bad data can contain implicit racial, gender, or ideological biases, and many AI systems will continue to be trained using biased or flawed data, making this an ongoing problem. AI bias is often explained by a poor understanding of the domain, data, and how it’s being used. The reality is, bias can creep in long before the data is collected, as well as at many other stages of the machine learning process. Some of these stages include:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. The data collection stage</strong><br /> There are two main ways that bias shows up in training data: either the data collected is not an accurate representation of reality, or it reflects existing prejudices. If a deep-learning algorithm receives more photos of light-skinned faces versus darker-skinned , a facial recognition system would inevitably be worse at recognising darker-skinned faces since it has few examples to learn from. Addressing the second case would be <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">Amazon’s internal recruiting tool</a> that dismissed female candidates. Because the system was trained on historical hiring decisions, which favoured men over women , it learned to do the same.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. The data preparations stage</strong><br /> The data preparation stage involves selecting which data or attributes of the data can be engineered into features you want the algorithm to consider when learning. Examples of “attributes” could be a customer’s age, location, income, gender, education level or years of experience. Choosing which attributes to consider or ignore can significantly influence a model’s prediction accuracy but also introduce bias. Individuals from previously disadvantaged backgrounds may be discriminated against due to a combination of attributes without intentionally doing so.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DatacollectionDIAGRAM.png" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Why AI bias is not an easy fix</strong><br /> Because AI is not a brand-new discovery, it is often believed that most problems should have been ironed out by now. But due to the complexity of AI biases and ever-changing technology and social landscapes, it’s not an easy fix. The truth is – you don’t know what you don’t know. This is probably the biggest complexity organisations have to deal with when trying to identify and solve biases in systems.</p> <p> </p> <p>The introduction of bias isn’t always obvious during a model’s construction because you may not realise the downstream impacts of your data and choices until much later. Once biases are discovered, it’s difficult to identify where it came from and how to get rid of it. Similarly, the way in which engineers and scientists are taught to frame problems often isn’t compatible with the best way to think about social problems. It’s also not clear what the absence of bias should look like.</p> <p> </p> <p>Most foundational laws and regulations were established in a different time, where the digital world didn’t exist. There have been instances of governing bodies adapting laws to try battle AI biases and information privacy, but it’s not always easy to keep up with rapidly advancing technologies. Laws and regulations struggle to keep up with the pace of new technologies and their uses that are constantly erupting and evolving.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Where to from here?</strong><br /> Fortunately, a strong group of AI researchers are working hard to address the problem. They’ve taken a variety of approaches, such as algorithms that help detect and mitigate the biases learned by the model regardless of the data quality. Since bias in AI has come to the fore in recent years, more influential figures, organisations and political bodies are taking a serious look at how to deal with the problem.</p> <p> </p> <p>AI has many potential benefits for businesses, the economy, and tackling society’s most pressing social challenges, including the impact of human biases and emotional decisions that have high global impact. But that will only be possible if people trust these systems to produce reliable, unbiased results.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Security tactics to minimise risks</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Securitytactics_Banner123.png" style="width: 100%;" /><br />  </p> <p>In today’s modern world, almost every business has a digital presence. Some businesses use digital tools to support their core offering and others rely on digital technology as their offering altogether. These technologies include customer-facing mobile and web applications, and back-office systems managing supply, demand and critical calculations. In more and more cases, huge data processing transmission, storage, and processing is happening. In these complex technical environments where data is being transmitted over the internet and other networks, information security becomes a factor that can pose risks and challenges.<br />  </p> <p><strong>The top ten security concerns you should know about</strong><br /> Although digital landscapes can be intricate, consisting of a number of different systems working together, there are some common information security concerns that surface. A reliable and popular source of these concerns is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 vulnerabilities list. OWASP is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the security of software. The OWASP Top 10 document highlights the first steps towards building more secure solutions. Here are the concerns explained in a relevant and human way for business and non-technical users:<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/OWASP_Top_10-03.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p><br /> <strong>Tactics to address security in your solutions</strong><br /> Security is all too often considered only when a solution is about to be released into the wild. Teams scramble to make fixes and shoehorn security features into a solution to meet deadlines and expectations. Information security should be considered from the start of any project. By leveraging simple tactics around education, collaboration, automation, and creating visibility; information security can become part of your process, rather than being a dreaded checkbox that compromises the solution and business at large.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Tacticstoaddresssecurity-04.png" style="width: 100%;" /><br />  </p> <p>The knowledge of the common security concerns, and the tactics for incorporating information security practices into your ways of work is the beginning. These principles and practices must be continuously reinforced within the organisation and teams. The goal should be to breed security as a concern into the culture of digital product development and engineering teams.<br /> To ensure better security implementation, we need to think not only about how technology can catch our mistakes or breaches after the fact, but help us work smarter and more securely from the earliest stages</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Unpacking the data deluge: 5 reasons why big data projects fail</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Unpackingthedatadeluge-BANNER.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The exponential growth of digital products and services means more data being gathered than ever before: customers, usage, patterns, and problems. With this growth, we have needed to store and manage it all, but more importantly, to figure out how to learn and benefit from it. This has driven the increasing popularity and desire to incorporate machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science into most new generation systems and products, these big data projects are often ambitious, and often failures.</p> <p> </p> <p>Industry is scrambling to capitalise on this data, causing a surge in demand for skilled data scientists, engineers and developers who can curate, store, process and analyse data. However, according to a Gartner report, at least <a href="https://designingforanalytics.com/resources/failure-rates-for-analytics-bi-iot-and-big-data-projects-85-yikes/" target="_blank">60% of big data projects fail</a> to even move past preliminary stages, but it’s predicted that these numbers could be closer to 85%. The overwhelming hype has led to unreasonable expectations from the business, and change is outpacing the production of competent professionals.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Bigdata-01.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Even though only a fraction of data science and analytics models that are developed actually make it into production usage, technology is not the only point of failure. In fact, technology is a minor cause of failure relative to the real culprits. We unpack 5 key reasons why big data projects fail below.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. Data science weekend warriors</strong><br /> Due to the growing hype around data, there has been an influx of interested people that are learning and practicing data science without experience. They can churn out something that looks great but isn’t necessarily accurate, and they struggle to productionalise it. They lack the theoretical background to understand which algorithms to use, and why certain algorithms work or don’t work in each context. Their exposure is generally a narrow portion of ML, limited to pet projects or data that they’ve been exposed to.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Productionalisation problems</strong><br /> Some data science is only meant for hypothesis testing and doesn’t need to be taken into production, but there are still multiple data science projects that do need to be productionalised. These projects fail when they can’t be productionalised due to data pipeline issues. Most data scientists want to deal with the ‘fun and attractive’ model building, without taking time to understand the end-to-end process. This leads to hacked together 'production' solutions that often fail and contribute to the large pool of unsuccessful projects in industry.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. Lack of data engineer skillsets</strong><br /> Everyone wants to be a data scientist but very few want to be data engineers. Typically, the industry needs double the amount of data engineers to data scientists, since around 60% of the work is prepping and pipelining data, and only 30% is covered in areas like machine learning. The skillset for data engineers is also quite different from that of data scientists, and much closer to a traditional software engineer, mixed with DevOps and the understanding of ML algorithms.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. Lack of customer buy-in</strong><br /> Due to the above issues, customers have been burnt by unsuccessful data science projects and are wary to offer their support. Badly productionalised solutions end up costing businesses more money than anticipated, weekend warriors who lack proper skill and experience take longer to reach a conclusion with their projects, and the lack of engineer skills makes deriving value from these projects more difficult.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5. Expecting ML to be a silver bullet</strong><br /> There is a common misconception that machine learning can do anything with any data. This lack of understanding of the meaningful use cases for ML can cause friction and unmet expectations. ML has its place, but if you aren’t sure what you want, any road will get you there. The proliferation of data makes this even more difficult, because people think data implies ML, without understanding the quality of the data and the problem they’re trying to address.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Bigdata-02.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>As more organisations turn to AI, ML and data science to drive decision making, introduce new products and maximise resources, the more important it becomes to ensure the success of big data projects. To avoid adding to the growing statistic of failed initiatives, businesses need to have a realistic data strategy in place to prepare for and avoid these pitfalls.</p> <p> </p> <p>Recruit or partner with experienced data professionals who have a proven track record of successful data projects. Do enough preparation and research before rushing models into production, and promote cross-skilling within your organisation to help fight the data skills gap. If you’re still having trouble with gaining customer buy-in, move slower and stay involved to ensure you remain on the right path. Finally, recognise that ML (or any data approach for that matter) is not a silver bullet, and time needs to be invested to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches before starting data projects without clear direction.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>PaaS has reignited industry need for custom software</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PaaS_Banner.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The early days of software tooling for businesses were quite unlike what we’re used to now. Decades ago, practically everything was custom-built because it needed to be. Packaged solutions weren’t on the market, and this custom technology is set at the core of most systems today and still performing well.</p> <p> </p> <p>All of this custom software had one glaring problem, which was driving up costs and making maintenance a nightmare for our IT teams: integration.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PaaSpullquote-1(1).png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>When one custom application needed to integrate to another, share data, or participate in a workflow, that integration needed to be custom too. With enough time, the number of custom integrations quickly created a mess of crossed lines and complex dependencies.</p> <p> </p> <p>We have always wanted total control over what we offer our customers, users and systems by way of functionality. We’ve also always wanted the tidier, bespoke nature of systems which do just what we want them to – and nothing more. This came with a mess of expensive integration tucked just out of sight.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PaaSpullquote-2(1).png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>This created a pressure gap in the market, as software had become more advanced and readily available, out-the-box solutions gained preference due to the convenience, faster time-to-market, and lower costs associated with them.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, this is starting to change once again.</p> <p> </p> <p>Enter platform-as-a-service (PaaS). PaaS is a category of cloud computing services that allows users to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure associated with running applications.</p> <p> </p> <p>PaaS gives you the opportunity to create a unique customer experience for users, without most of the disadvantages of wiring everything together. This suddenly makes custom development more cost-effective.</p> <p> </p> <p>Packaged solutions still have their place in technology landscapes. You would very rarely rebuild an HR or payroll system, because they’re standard for most organisations and don’t need any unique functionalities.</p> <p> </p> <p>But for more functional systems, such as pricing and quoting, customer-facing products and services (like your digital channels), and specialised workflows, custom-built is once again the more sensible route. In financial services, big names who have been winning customers over in the last few years, are those who have been creating innovative digital channels. Leveraging a PaaS approach provides the necessary flexibility and versatility to support such innovation.</p> <p> </p> <p>PaaS eliminates the need to build the fundamentals for applications from scratch. With back-end infrastructure standardised and consistent for an entire ecosystem, it offers your in-house development team new capabilities, without the need to hire specialised staff (usually on legacy frameworks and languages) or outsource activities.</p> <p> </p> <p>This all contributes to reducing the costs normally associated with custom development. Cost savings are a nice bonus when building custom solutions, but fundamentally, enterprise PaaS is about exploiting a competitive advantage through leveraging the consistent infrastructure and integration strategy presented.</p> <p> </p> <p>Thanks to the maturing of cloud-based platforms. Custom is now not only cost-effective for a broad range of applications once again, but also provides enterprises with more control over user experience, functionality and timing. Custom has been reignited and is here to stay, and will most likely expand even more in the years to come to take back more of the market share lost over the past two decades.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Avoiding disaster in a software outsource relationship</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Do due diligence on your potential partner</strong> <br /> <br /> Not doing a proper due diligence check on a potential business partner is probably the biggest mistake one can make. You’re under pressure and the person you’re dealing with seems impressive and knowledgeable, so you go for it – only to find down the line that deadlines have been missed because of all sorts of issues and excuses, despite your partner having the best intent at the project outset. <br /> <br /> Choosing the right partner should not be done hastily. Meet the directors of the company and do your homework on them; check for judgements, get SARS clearance certificates, phone clients for references and physically visit the company’s premises and meet key staff. Ascertain if the company has the appropriate support structures, ensure there is a culture-fit with your organisation and, most importantly, review CV’s and meet the people who will be working on your project. Understand how the potential partner manages projects similar to yours – ask for evidence or get expert consultants to conduct appropriate audits if need be. It is also important to ensure that the company is in a strong enough financial position to carry the costs of default if contract milestones are not met. <br /> <strong><br /> Note the quality of the proposal</strong><br /> <br /> Make sure that the potential partner writes a high quality proposal, understands your requirements and has accurately presented them. The most senior staff are typically responsible for writing proposals, and the quality of the proposal will tell you a lot about the company and its people. Engage with the supplier in this process and ensure that they are on the same page as you.<br /> <br /> <strong>Own the source code</strong><br /> <br /> If a software product can’t be demonstrated, or is not demonstrably rolled out to a number of clients, you can safely assume that the vendor is designing and developing a custom built solution. Most corporate systems have a significant amount of custom requirements because, more often than not, systems are tailored around a business, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> Unless a solution is truly pre-packaged and supported, insist on owning the source code and ensure that this is stipulated in the terms of your agreement. Also ensure that appropriate technical documentation is delivered on handover, and that it is written in a way that it can be maintained by an alternative development team if need be. I have seen a number of companies being held over a barrel for exorbitant licence fees for a system that was developed exclusively for them, has been paid for in full, and then they still pay development fees for software upgrades that they don’t own.  Solutions that demand licence fees are typically highly commoditised with large footprints, such as accounting, relationship management, web management or online retail packages.<br /> <strong><br /> Make sure you are charged a fair hourly rate</strong><br /> <br /> If you are using an independent contractor that has been supplied by a labour brokerage, then it is fair to add a 15% to 30% margin on the actual fee paid to the contractor, this fee is often negotiable. The recruitment agency typically needs to recover the costs of advertising, sourcing the candidate, negotiating contracts and paying salaries. Independent contractors demand higher hourly fees as the contract risk is on them. Bear in mind that bringing in “bodies” from agencies and having teams effectively under your management does have more risk associated with it as there is little recourse in the event of poor quality output.<br /> <br /> Alternatively, if you engage with a software vendor as a supplier, a premium can be charged with the proviso that more value will be delivered than just a team of contractors. The best form of engagement in our experience is for the vendor to take ownership of the delivery of a project. In this instance, ensure that the vendor has all the right credentials, supporting infrastructure, design processes, technologies and, most importantly, academically qualified software engineers or computer scientists. Would you hire an unqualified engineer to build and sign off a bridge? The same level of engineering professionalism should apply in the design and delivery of a piece of software – in particular if it is core to one’s business. <br /> <br /> To mitigate risks on a project I would recommend that the software vendor commits to a fixed price based on the delivery of specific milestones. For bigger systems, an initial “paid for” audit is usually conducted, with the outcome being milestone-based pricing, a project plan, functional specifications and an application level architecture design. The quality of this document can also serve as further security in the competence of the vendor before launching into a project.<br /> <br /> <strong>Is it cheaper or lower risk to hire your own software staff or to outsource?</strong><br /> <br /> If you perform the equation “(time to delivery) times (hourly fees) over (quality as a percentage)”, a good software outsource partner should come out at a lower number than if the project was performed by your in-house development staff. By quality I refer to a product that is easy to maintain, user friendly and bug free. <br /> <br /> One large client of ours conducted an independent productivity audit on some of our teams and the results were quite staggeringly in our favour when compared to output levels of their in-house teams (after all why pay more when you can hire your own cheaper?). There are a number of reasons for this that are too lengthy to cover in this article, suffice to say that the output levels of a specialist design house will always be higher than one whose core business is something else. After all, would you go to the headache of sourcing, hiring and managing permanent staff to electrify and cable your expensive offices or would you use the services of a specialist electrical and cabling company? <br /> <br /> Over and above complete project outsourcing, we have had huge successes where we have taken over technical leadership and ownership of delivery of projects, often working side by side with existing in-house support teams – where often all that is required to speed delivery up is some specialist input and guidance. <br /> <strong><br /> What is the make-up of a good software outsource team</strong><br /> <br /> In our experience, the best outsource projects work where the software vendor is given full ownership of design and delivery (assuming the right partner of course).  Notwithstanding, a successful project requires a project champion on the client side to facilitate access to key business and technical people. In our experience, a typical outsource development team usually compromises a team lead who handles the client engagement, staff management and full life cycle of the project. The team lead must have strong prior development experience to lead effectively. A technical lead (or architect) needs to be involved during the initial design phases, while the rest of the team is usually made up of a senior software engineer who is a development environment specialist, followed by intermediate and junior level software engineers with proven problem solving ability and qualification. We have found, even with the best design process and methodology, the single most important factor in a software project is the quality of the people on the job, both from an attitude and problem-solving perspective. A good outsource partner should have a knack for consistently identifying, retaining and managing such people; otherwise it’s a case of hit-and-miss.<br /> <br /> <strong>Finally, how is it possible to gauge if the software partner is doing a good job? </strong><br /> <br /> In our experience, the best way to ensure that a project is on track is to follow an “agile” approach, i.e., set lots of small targets and make sure that these are met and continually aligned with the project plan. Weekly progress report meetings are important because software projects are never exactly defined up-front and involve some iteration. Expecting a business owner to define a detailed specification in advance is not reasonable in a complex system, so a level of on-going refinement in the build phase is part of the process. We often create by seeing, so this level of flexibility must be allowed by the software partner.<br /> <br /> Getting the architectural basics right at the outset of a project is the most critical part of the project. If there is any doubt about a vendor’s ability, it is at this time – before development work starts – that a technical audit should be done to see if the design is a good one. Building a system on a weak foundation that has not been designed with change in mind, is a recipe for disaster. A good software partner should understand where the system (and business) can potentially go and should cater for this at design time.  After all, all large scale systems evolve just like a good business!<br /> <br />]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Comment by Charles Pritchard, CEO of Entelect: We often hear horror stories about companies appointing a software partner and, many millions of rands later, deadlines are missed and excuses are made for non-delivery. I have personally seen it happen with companies that have invested in good business plans, only to be stumped by a software project gone wrong. With big blue-chip companies who have comprehensive support structures, the same can happen: project deadlines keep getting missed, often with unrecoverable costs to the business. So how does one go about choosing the right partner to ensure delivery in software projects?]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Technical debt reversal – development process most effective solution</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2014 9:23:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[According to Matthew Butler, GM of Projects at Entelect, “Technical debt reversal is definitely something we are starting to see more of with Chief Information Officers (CIO) and Development Managers. In our experience, technical debt remains one of our most challenging points of contention. Whether engaged in fully outsourced work, or more flexible resource or co-source engagements, technical debt is unavoidable.”<br /> <br /> Technical debt can be quite simply described as having two primary causes: poor code quality resulting in the systemic decay of the software’s ability to perform as required or functional and system requirements flexing and shifting too far away from the original goals of the software’s architecture, and again hampering its ability to support the new requirements adequately. It’s clear that in cases where both have happened, the symptoms can be quite dire.<br /> <br /> “We assist our clients with how to process this debt; which involves describing what it is and why it is there in the first place. Justifying the additional expense required to do any kind of work again is especially challenging in the South African context as budgets are often tight. In most cases, business may not understand the impact or risk of the debt and are often comfortable carrying it. Internally, with outsourced projects, the same exists, with the only difference being that we can more easily measure and manage it,” says Butler.<br /> <br /> Technical debt is very often seen to only affect legacy systems, or software that may need to integrate with them. This is a common misconception and it is important to recognise that technical debt is definitely not limited to these legacy systems. “It not only affects newer and more modern systems but applies to systems still in development, and extends to our philosophy that every line of code written is a liability as soon as it is compiled. It’s a scary thought, incurring technical debt on such a micro level, but not as bad as it sounds when you have the tools to understand and mitigate against it,” adds Butler.<br /> <br /> There are a number of solutions and methods for addressing technical debt. Firstly, along with the trend of awareness surrounding technical debt, the focus on tools to detect it and the improvement of the development environment has emerged as a principle area of focus. There are a number of tools that assist with static code analysis and package management which make life substantially easier.<br /> <br /> Secondly, process is key – especially development process. “A considered approach to development, with either a fully agile methodology, or at least an appreciation for incremental and iterative delivery, is in our experience, by far the most effective. By taking your time to evaluate the situation, business rule conflicts are detected earlier and less pressure means code quality stabilises at the team’s true capability. The central point here is that once the problem is well understood, the build itself is easy. With problems solved, emphasis can be put on future-proofing, and code quality as required,” explains Butler.<br /> <br /> Another effective option is to enable the business stakeholders to identify technical debt themselves. Awareness and understanding at that level goes a long way in reducing friction between business and IT, and makes for open communication and planning as a team.<br /> <br /> “Testing is also a much advertised answer to this. Testing at all levels makes measurement of technical debt easier and provides a clear point-in-time picture of the health of the system. However, it only goes so far, and in our experience, technical debt is a hazard that is only visible with some amount of retrospect. In other words, you can’t measure the debt before it is incurred,” explains Butler.<br /> <br /> “The last effective mitigation involves standards. Having a set of technical, process, tooling and technology standards is an important part of a healthy development team and also contributes positively to reducing technical debt. With the team being able to refer to both examples and standards, code quality improves and time is less impacted, which can then be spent on code- or architecture-reviews and more valuable feedback,” concludes Butler.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The 'in-memory' future</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately, it is hard to read an IT business magazine without encountering an article on how ‘in-memory’ is going to change everything. While the recent developments around in-memory analytics and processing are indeed very promising, it is worth having a look at the underlying technologies, before jumping on the bandwagon. The discussions on in-memory often include one or more of the following:<br /> <br /> Big data<br /> Flash memory<br /> In-memory analytics<br /> In-memory transactional processing. <br /> <br /> <strong>Big data</strong><br /> <br /> ‘Big data’ is itself a buzzword. 5GB of relational banking transactional data a week is not big data but on the other hand, CERN’s Large Hadron Collider’s experimental results, at 6GB/second, are much more in the big data category. At its core, big data refers to data that is too large, too fast and/or too varied to be processed with traditional data-processing methods. It is not just about size, big data implies that there is a lot of data, that it is accumulating quickly and that it is unstructured. While big data may be processed using in-memory techniques, as a result of the size of the data involved, it is not likely to be stored in memory. Aggregations may be stored in memory, temporarily or permanently, but not the data itself.<br /> <br /> <strong>Flash memory</strong><br /> <br /> When talking about in-memory, it is important to distinguish what kind of memory is being spoken of. Flash memory is a high-speed, non-volatile storage technology. It is what is used in Solid State Hard Drives (SSDs). While significantly faster than traditional magnetic media, flash memory is still a storage technology. However, it can be used to extend a server’s main memory as in the case of SQL Server 2014’s Buffer Pool Extensions. Generally, flash memory is used to reduce or remove the IO latency from applications that store and retrieve large amounts of data, like relational database engines. Since flash storage in the form of SSDs appear as regular drives, the applications using them need no special code or changes to handle them.<br /> <br /> <strong>In-memory analytics </strong><br /> <br /> In-memory analytics allows for very fast querying and analysis of data. It encompasses applications such as Tableau and the PowerPivot plugin for Microsoft’s Excel. In-memory analytics will often store data in columnar format, as opposed to the traditional row-based storage seen in relational databases. Columnar storage enables a very high compression rate, allowing for high speed analytics. The high compression means that large data sets can be worked on in-memory. Typically, the data is stored on durable storage and processed in-memory.<br /> <br /> <strong>In-memory transactional processing</strong><br /> <br /> With in-memory OLTP engines, the data is stored in volatile memory and persisted at intervals to durable storage (flash memory or traditional magnetic drives). In-memory OLTP allows for extremely fast transactional processing, making it suitable for applications that need very high insert rates and to execute huge numbers of small transactions. Examples of this are stock market trading, telephone exchanges and on-line stores. Solutions in this area include the Hekaton feature in Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (renamed as In-memory OLTP) and Oracle’s TimesTen In-Memory Database engine.<br /> <br /> <strong>Right solution in the right place </strong><br /> <br /> Whichever form of in-memory solution is being considered, it is critically important that it not be implemented as a ‘solution looking for a problem’. The problems the various in-memory solutions solve are very different from one another. There is no gain from deploying in-memory solutions for the sake of doing so. Any solution must be carefully considered in the light of what problem it is expected to solve and what gains it is expected to give. Like with most areas of technology, there is unfortunately no magic solution for all problems to be found here.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Gail Shaw (Entelect Technical Lead: SQL Server)</strong> <br/><br/> Recent developments around in-memory analytics and processing are very promising but the underlying technologies need to be understood. These include big data, flash memory, in-memory analytics and in-memory transactional processing.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>How to effectively engage with a software-services provider</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Failed engagements can be costly in terms of effort, time and, of course, money. Meaningful relationships, on the other hand, can save you all three of these but they require commitment from both sides. Following these steps will ensure that you start these engagements on the right foot.<br /> <strong> <br /> 1. Find the right partner </strong><br /> Identifying the right partner is an exercise that can cause an organisation to reflect on its own culture and objectives. Identifying a partner whose values align with your own company’s is important because the individuals who embrace those values, will be an integral part of your project teams.<br /> <br /> To determine which service provider is best suited to your company’s goals, there are a few questions you need to ask to determine how serious the provider is about its staff and approach: <ul id="careersList"> <li>How strong is the company culture and identity?</li> <li>Does the provider performance-manage its staff in a structured and meaningful way?</li> <li>How does the supplier drive positive behaviour in its organisation?</li> <li>What kind of continuous-improvement and career-development processes does the provider have in place for its staff?</li> <li>Does the provider have technical expertise on your technology platform and implementing the type of solution that you are expected to deliver?</li> <li>Does the provider have a strong track record of delivery with companies similar to yours?</li> <li>What other services and value-adds does the company provide?</li> </ul> <br /> The answers to these questions should inform your decision on partnerships. Without well-thought-out programmes covering these areas, your provider could end up being nothing more than a labour broker. Companies whose core function it is to connect talent with end-users are more likely to let borderline candidates slip through the process in order to meet your demand. More importantly, they may not be able to effectively solve software-development environment challenges. There is generally a very weak retention rate at these companies and a poor, or even absent, sense of employee engagement. This means that their HR challenges become your HR challenges and their churn becomes your churn. With large-scale offshore companies, this problem is further exacerbated by visa and immigration issues, sometimes poor technical quality as well as communication and cultural barriers.<br /> <br /> There are some software-development companies that have a well-defined company culture and a comprehensive collection of experience that comes from managing large-scale software projects across multiple industries. Forging a strong partnership with an experienced software company will allow you to leverage a deep technical skill set as well as a dynamic collection of experience, distilled from years of working with peers and competitors. Whether it is effective knowledge-sharing through collaborative techniques, formal training programmes or implementing DevOps, these suppliers can guide you through the process and will be incentivised to do so if the relationship is meaningful to both parties. At Entelect, we often find that clients who recognise the value of our relationship and leverage our experience often gain the benefits of a more flexible model, optimised rates and an implicit advisory relationship.<br /> <br /> The size of the company can play an important role, too. Larger service providers have a focus on scale and aggressive growth. The upside of such providers is that they can offer scale where smaller companies cannot. This can, at some levels, lead to an ‘anyone-goes’ approach because the scramble to assemble teams at scale can pose a challenge. However, the strategy is usually to compensate for the weaker individuals on the team by placing strong, experienced team leaders and development managers to pick up the slack and act as quality gatekeepers on the project. Smaller companies usually place a greater emphasis on growing cautiously with the right fit of individual and technical skill set because their ability to take on risk is limited. These companies will also have different priorities. As a growing, young company, the focus will be on maturing internal processes, building a company brand and identity and delivering on a smaller number of key accounts.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Begin with the intention of partnering</strong><br /> One thing is certain: you will be competing for priority regardless of the service provider you choose. It is always a good idea start your discussions by making it clear that you are interested in forging a partnership that will be mutually beneficial to both companies. If the provider is not the right partner, this will become clear with time. It is perfectly acceptable to start with a thin initial commitment as long as there is an understanding that there is a partnership on the line at the end of that contract.<br /> <br /> Most software development companies have the challenge of demand outstripping supply and they have to prioritise their resources across multiple clients while balancing their commitments to their clients and to their business. This means that they need to be sure that they are making the best decision for sustainable business in terms of where to invest their efforts and resources. When clients are looking for short-term, quick-win relationships, they are more unlikely to prioritise the requirement.<br /> <br />  A successful partnership requires transparency on both sides, and your partner should be held accountable for its performance. Things do not always go to plan in these partnerships and providers do not always get it right – having a partner who is willing to recognise failure and take meaningful remediation steps quickly will be a great asset to you. Whether it is having a dedicated account manager who is always available to take your call, or a direct line to a senior manager, having access to swift and flexible remediation options will help you to deal effectively with turbulence and to hold your partners accountable.<br /> <br /> <strong> 3. Deploy careful negotiation tactics</strong><br /> Negotiating engagement terms and rates is healthy and a great way to manage the performance of your partnership. However, it is something that should be done carefully, and in such a way that takes into account the scale, potential and value of your current relationship. If priority and quality are your concern, you may want to hold off on aggressive negotiation tactics until your partnership has matured because this could have a very real and direct impact on prioritisation and the level of service that you receive. On the other hand, if you are not happy with your service provider, you can use aggressive negotiation tactics to motivate the provider to a better place of service. As a client procuring services, you have the unique ability to motivate and manage the performance of your provider through opportunity and negotiation. Using metrics such as market-related rates, opportunities, performance of individuals and service levels are all great inputs to the negotiation process.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Provide a fast track through the red tape</strong><br /> Most corporate IT divisions have internal screening processes that include a combination of online automated tests, assignments and interviews. The process can be complicated and protracted, and is a main reason why candidates take up offers at competitors or service providers. This can also be a turn-off for software development companies as it means spending more billable time pushing through red tape. More importantly, your screening process might focus on different strengths from your providers, which means that you may screen out potentially great candidates whom your provider highly recommends.<br /> <br />  If you are comfortable with the level of service from your providers, it can be hugely beneficial to use a fast track through the red tape. Of course, your provider must first earn this privilege by proving a strong track record of providing high-calibre resources and services to you.<br /> <br /> Attributes such as strong problem solving, a solid foundation in computer science and object-oriented programming principles are important for software companies who operate across multiple technology platforms and industries. A corporate IT division that utilises specific frameworks may look for individuals with specialised experience on that platform or framework, and potentially screen out provider resources without adequate experience on that platform. There may be a differing ideology here that puts you and your provider at loggerheads – specialist versus generalist. Given that the provider has your interests in mind, it may be time to have that discussion with them in order to understand why they believe that generalist skills will work in your environment and to be on the same page with your approach. Being open to stretching your technology skills requirements might play to your advantage and allow you to build stronger teams, faster.<br /> <br /> Resource availability can last anything from minutes to days in the software engineering world, but seldom weeks or months. A company’s priority is to make firm commitments on its resources as quickly as possible and to minimise bench-time. This can often lead to a first-come first-served scenario. If you have been sent a proposal for a team of developers, try to turn it around as quickly as possible to secure the resources. If your provider is being slow and non-committal, do not hesitate to hold the company accountable for your deliveries – the provider has an obligation to enable your organisation.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. Own the relationship</strong><br /> HR departments are great at facilitating the recruitment process for staff but they tend to be disruptive when dealing with specialist resource providers, such as software companies. In some cases, this comes down to a combination of poor relationship management (remember, they are dealing with a high volume of recruiters, candidates, clients and providers), lack of prioritisation (in certain circumstances they are providing HR and recruitment services for many business units) and a conflict of interest. The relationship with your provider needs to be managed carefully in order to maintain value and priority and to deal with issues or concerns effectively. If you are in a position to transform the way the HR works with strategic service providers, you will benefit by training them on the challenges you, as an IT department, face and the value of certain provider relationships. In this case, involving HR in the process and ‘coaching’ them to facilitate the relationship may introduce a cultural change that could result in better provider management within your company. If you do not have a say in how services are procured or managed, a better approach is to maintain a direct channel with your service provider and be a buffer between the provider and HR.<br /> <br /> <strong>6. Integrate contractors into your team</strong><br /> When the team is on the ground and it is a co-sourced mix (both permanent staff and contractors), your next challenge is to ensure that everyone operates as a single team, unified under the same vision and goal. Unfortunately, some leaders openly voice their objections regarding contract staff and this can be extremely damaging to your provider relationships, team dynamics and the contractors themselves. Understanding why contractors are a necessary asset to your company will help to maintain an integrated culture. Conversely, and equally important, is that your provider has a responsibility to ensure that its resources are technically capable and a good cultural fit for your organisation. This combined message and understanding will ensure that all parties involved are invested in your company’s overall success.<br /> <br /> In a market where talented software engineers are progressively scarce to come by and even harder to retain, software engineering partners can be an incredibly valuable asset to a corporate IT division. Recognising the importance of the elastic workforce, industry and technology agnostic expertise, and leveraging this through a mutually beneficial relationship can help give a new slick of paint to your IT culture, vision and ability to deliver on that mountain of project work in the pipeline. Investing some time in the relationships with your providers may be the most important thing you do in 2015.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Taking cybercrime seriously</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[This figure is sure continue to rise in parallel to the continued rapid expansion of the Internet – the technological phenomenon which, although becoming available for commercial use just two decades ago, now plays an integral part in both our personal and professional lives.<br /> <br /> The South African government’s State Security Agency (SSA) has expressed growing concerns around Internet usage and the extent to which both private individuals and businesses have begun to rely on it. ‘With Wi-Fi being implemented almost anywhere, being online is as important as running water and electricity nowadays,’ says Entelect’s General Manager of Business Development, Mark Beets, ‘More and more businesses have become fundamentally reliant on the Internet and connectivity in order to operate. The importance of maintaining the integrity of these systems, not only for their customers but alo for business continuity, has become one of the biggest challenges.’<br /> <br /> While increasing mobility is celebrated for rapidly enhancing our daily lives and business processes, it is also creating more complex security threats. ‘While many cybercriminals still practise the more “small-time” crime of hacking individual computers or devices, the masses of information now stored and run through cloud-based and connected servers have also seen a marked increase in cybercriminals attacking organisation infrastructure through online touch-points,’ Beets explains. ‘This poses a substantial threat to any individual with personal or sensitive information stored digitally, across any number of devices, as well as to large businesses that have based their systems on digital platforms and infrastructure.’ The primary goals of cybercrime include theft, extortion and fraud, which all have potentially devastating consequences for victims.<br /> <br /> Further increasing the risk to personal information is the continued growth of the Internet of things (IoT). ‘With information constantly being sent and received by a massive number of sources, ranging from your office equipment and personal devices to your refrigerator at home and even your clothes, means that the amount of data being stored in the cloud by any individual is increasing exponentially. As a result, the risk of data breaches is increasing in parallel,’ explains Beets. ‘Soon the use of Internet will be extremely difficult to avoid because the IoT is becoming the modus operandi of many companies and individuals for their day to day processes, and as such, education on data security is becoming more and more crucial.’ <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2015/05/27/A-hacker-is-on-the-line" target="_blank">Vodacom’s Chief Technology Security Officer</a>, Vernon Fryer, has been quoted as saying that South Africa is the fourteenth most popular target for cybercriminals, with South Africans underestimating how at risk they are when sharing information and using the Internet.<br /> <br /> Among a variety of troublesome trends, which were flagged in the CISCO 2014 Annual Security Report, Android mobile devices bore the brunt of 99 per cent of all mobile malware (malicious software). Furthermore, the report indicated a shortage of more than one million security professionals across the globe in 2014. ‘Most organisations at the moment do not have the required systems or skills to be able to monitor networks and detect infiltrations, and then apply protections in a timely and effective manner,’ Beets continues.<br /> <br /> According to Beets, software organisations can play an important role because they have the ability to empower their clients and educate them regarding the potential risks to their businesses. ‘A proper understanding creates the opportunity to proactively take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from cybercrime, which is vital to the survival of most modern businesses and the protection of their sensitive or personal information.’<br /> <br /> Based on the most notorious cybercrimes, Beets offers the following advice to companies and individuals:<br /> <br /> <strong>Beware of unrecognisable links</strong>: do not click on these links when they are sent to you. This is a tactic used by hackers called phishing. Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to get individuals to reveal personal information online. These emails could be spam and expose you to fraudulent activity. Your systems can also be infiltrated by hackers when you download content from unknown sites, which can be triggered automatically by clicking on these suspicious links.<br /> <br /> <strong>Update your passwords regularly:</strong> up to three times per month. This is crucial to ensure your online information is secured at all times. Do not use birth dates, graduation years, or your mother’s maiden name as security answers to access your online accounts – this makes a hacker’s job even easier. By generating strong passwords you can make it much harder for hackers to break into your computer via the back-end code of the system.<br /> <br /> <strong>Understand that identity theft is real</strong>: identity theft has become increasingly common and is something everyone needs to worry about. Identity theft is when a criminal accesses data about a person’s bank accounts and bank cards, social security and other sensitive information, to siphon money, engage in contracts or to make purchases in the victim’s name. Always logout of your accounts properly – this is a good policy to protect yourself against identity theft and cyberfraud, which is the distribution of rogue security software to conduct fraudulent transactions.<br /> <br /> <strong>Protect against malware</strong>: malware is Internet-based software or programs that are used to disrupt a network and steal sensitive data, often causing damage to software present in the system. Malware can be installed in a variety of forms, from Trojan horses and spyware to viruses and worms. Investing in reputable security, firewall and anti-virus systems is crucial, and even with these in place, it is advised that you make use of public wireless internet providers sparingly. These Wi-Fi networks that are available in airports, coffee shops and hotels often do not require encryption of data traveling between laptops and the Internet. This means that all your information is unsecured to hackers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Avoid sharing devices with others:</strong> if you must and want your personal information to be undetectable by the person with whom you are sharing, you can browse incognito through the use of Google Chrome. By using Chrome, your browsing history and cookies will not show up in the history stored on device programmes. However, incognito mode does not hide your IP address, which means that your location, browser, operating system, as well as your own address, are not hidden by using this mode.<br /> <br /> <strong>Scramble your information</strong>: one way to do this is to make use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs allow users to make sure that all information that passes between your device and the network is subjected to extreme encryption, making data safer.<br /> <br /> ‘While we are aware of a certain number of cybercrimes, hackers develop new techniques constantly to trick you into unwittingly sharing your personal information,’ warns Beets, ‘Knowing how to protect yourself can significantly add value and safety to your life online. Be cautious!’ he concludes.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Building projects and products – is there a difference?</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[At Entelect it is apparent that awareness of the differences between these two concepts needs to be promoted, mainly because the mind-set and approach required for each are different, and using the wrong combination means guaranteed friction and/or an engagement failure that could have been avoided.<br /> <br /> It is very important to note that software solutions do not need to be polarised into either the project or product category. Each solution or engagement falls into the spectrum somewhere between the ‘quick and dirty’ project and the full-blown product. With this in mind, let’s first look at some of generally understood differences, which most project managers or product owners will already know: <ol id="careersList"> <li>Audience: Projects will generally have a more specific, internal functionality set, tailored to a certain audience, such as one department or one customer. It is not a stretch to stereotype projects as customer-specific software. Products need to leverage broader functionality for often a larger and/or external audience.</li> <li>Delivery: A project typically needs to provide only a specific set of deliverables. Examples could include a workflow system customised to a business process, or a new online capture form for customer feedback. A product must provide a viable solution for ongoing business, which is likely to include preparation and planning for the product life cycle: growth, adaptation, enhancement and decline from the software development perspective. Good examples of this include Salesforce.com and the Uber mobile apps.</li> <li>Time: Projects should be time-limited while products generally have a roadmap, but only loosely defined timelines up front.</li> <li>Return: Projects will often have an indirect return on investment through efficiencies gained, load reduction on teams, reduced operational or staff requirements and so forth. Products typically need to have a direct return on investment in such a way that, over a period of time, the product generates direct revenue to pay for its own development and enhancement.</li> <li>Development: Projects are often outsourced as contained pieces of work. Products are not usually outsourced, especially not for core business IP or competency.</li> </ol> Added to this list, there are other important differences that are not as well understood and can at times be overlooked: <ol id="careersList"> <li>Users: Projects regularly have a focused feature set and a controlled set of users. Control in this case means you know specifically who the users are (often they might have no choice but to use the software as part of their work). At the very least, you can chat to them and get direct feedback. Software products often need a large user base to be successful and this can impact many other decisions during the development process – we will see this influence coming through in the points below.</li> <li>Quality: As a consequence of a larger, and less-controlled user base, products need to prioritise quality. For any product, things such as first impressions, performance and user experience are critical for adoption and brand value. Another aspect is longevity. Code quality is crucial for products because should the product be successful in the marketplace, existing source code will need to be worked on for the foreseeable future. However, this is not to say that quality does not matter in a project, but it is less important.</li> <li>Technology: When developing a software project for a specific customer, generally technology choices are constrained to what tools and platforms are already in place. With product development, often the best and latest tools and technologies are needed to give the product the best chance it has in the marketplace.</li> <li>Architecture: There is an industry-wide buzz around building ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) systems. Although the topic is beyond the scope of this article, the point is that architecture must suit the intended usage of the solution. Large products will require broad, and sometimes complex, infrastructure to allow for things such as multi-tenants, data partitioning, high availability, elastic resources and shared caching. Projects tend to be more predictable.</li> <li>Adaptability: Software products (think Microsoft Office or Eclipse IDE) have demands from multiple customers, so they need to adapt to varying customer requirements both now and in the future. This requirement is far more muted for projects.</li> <li>Testing: With a project, ‘just good enough’ will more often than not suffice for the intended purpose. However, as a consequence of the user base, products require the accommodation of more hardware and software configurations.</li> <li>Investment: It is probably clear now from the differences tabled so far that building custom software products is expensive. More time is required for planning and executing a good software product solution that caters for the variability, quality, testing, user breadth, and the other product features mentioned, and time is the key cost factor for software development.</li> </ol> At Entelect, we like to use a set of questions to help stimulate the thought process to guide the project/product owner to an understanding of where on the spectrum their solution lies: <ul id="careersList"> <li>Is it for your company (internal system), or is it for users whom you would consider customers?</li> <li>Do you want to make a direct income from the solution?</li> <li>At the moment, are there any users of the system that you do not yet know of?</li> <li>Is there a market demand for your system – would anybody else want to use it? If so, would you expect them to use it as-is or would you need to tailor it?</li> <li>Does the solution represent a ‘core competency’ – would this software solution be the key revenue driver for the business?</li> <li>Does the system need to be highly adaptable?</li> </ul> If you are answering ‘yes’ to these questions, it means the solution leans more to the product side and answering ‘no’ pushes it more to the project side. This really is a key point to establish as early as possible in process. With this positioning known, the next steps will feel more natural for the topics above. You can proceed with more confidence with your technology roadmaps, scoping, test planning, competitor analysis, project vision, architecting and budgeting.<br /> <br /> Successful projects and products start with positioning the solution or idea on the project-product spectrum and then tackling all of the topics raised (particularly approach, budget and timelines) in a way that is tailored to that position. Ultimately, when building software, and especially when looking to outsource, knowing whether you are building a project or a product is a great head start for setting expectations, vision and driving decisions.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<h3> Matthew Butler (Entelect Software General Manager) </h3> When building software solutions, whether internally or outsourced, much of the focus is often on enforcing budget and deadlines, or on risks, such as choosing and implementing the right methodologies, technologies and platforms. Included in this list of pitfalls is a topic that does not get as much airtime as it deserves: understanding the differences between developing a software project and developing a software product.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Next level analytics competency – part one</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The presentation addressed the main issues in the shift from data as an IT asset, to data as a main asset for decision making. <br /> I took a look at traditional business intelligence ecosystems and how we all thought it was going to be done: the perfect situation of taking data from source systems, creating a unified data model and data store and thereafter, having a set of business users accessing only that data model.<br /> <br /> The reality is that business has never really been happy with this approach. This approach can cause a lot of red tape, and rightfully so. Incorporating a new source system into a data warehouse, requires a lot of planning, data analysis, identifying business rules, cleaning data and ultimately, making it available to business. The red tape almost makes me happy – it means that data warehouses or business intelligence environments are mission-critical systems, changing them shouldn’t be an easy process and they should be treated as core business systems. The by-product of the red tape however, is that now, organisations typically have several rogue MIS systems that IT departments often have no knowledge about. Sometimes, these systems are running on local machines and have no backup or business continuity strategies. This isn’t a bad thing by any means and if anything, it shows that people are willing to break the rules to ensure they can make data-driven decisions. <br /> <br /> So what are the steps to creating a data driven culture? Eric Schmidt of Google says, “We run the company by questions and not answers,” and this speaks to the first step in the process, which is to to define the question. We then need to choose the right data to get what we are looking for. Big Data is about finding an answer to a question that we never knew we had – pick the right subset of data and use just that. Don’t bloat your initiatives with too much data from too many data sources. For example, if you don’t need users’ tweets to get to the answer you are looking for, then don’t include them in the data set you are analysing. The last three steps in the process are self-explanatory and are repeated. We need to analyse the data, present it through an intuitive interface and make the decision.<br /> <br /> In the second part of my <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=53113" target="_blank">presentation</a>, I looked at different ways in which organisations can develop analytical talent as well as how to transform culture, capabilities and technology.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The latest on cybercrime and cybersecurity in South Africa</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Cybersecurity remains a huge issue throughout the world and South Africa is no exception. Currently, the South African government in the process of passing new legislation – the Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill. The new bill will allow it to define the offences for such attacks, with the list of offences being drastically expanded, and the fines for existing infringements being increased. This goes hand in hand with ensuring that electronic service providers carry out certain obligations relating to and impacting cybersecurity. In addition to this, the president is adding legislation that will allow him to collaborate with foreign states in order to combat cybercrime in an official capacity.</div> <div> </div> <div>For a long time, the United Kingdom has striven to be one of the safest destinations to do online business. The country’s vision for 2015 was to tackle cybercrime head-on, be more impervious to cyber attacks and to create an open, unwavering and pulsating cyberspace that the public could use without fear, a cyberspace that supports open societies. To this end, the United Kingdom had to have the know-how in terms of the latest skills, knowledge and capabilities in order to meet its cybersecurity objectives. It also meant:</div> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>The public has had to know how to protect itself online</li> <li>Businesses in the United Kingdom have had to be up to date on how to fight cybercrime and have done this by working with their government and using its strengths to do this. This has encouraged businesses to operate securely in cyberspace</li> <li>The United Kingdom’s government has had to improve its law enforcement response to cybercrime, its defences and infrastructure to detect and combat cybercrime, as well as education and skills</li> <li>The United Kingdom’s government has had to help its country to take opportunities to provide the cybersecurity services that is needed across the world. These have allowed the country to build relationships with other countries, organisations and business around the globe in order to create an open and bustling cyberspace.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <div>In response to this new draft bill, South Africa has already started collaborating with United Kingdom and the European Council on Cybercrime to achieve the following:</div> <p> </p> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>A Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in case of a terrorist attack on critical governmental information infrastructures – the United Kingdom has the experience and has made it its mission to assist other countries with all issues relating to cybersecurity</li> <li>A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is being written for the cybercrime labs in cooperation with the European Council on Cybercrime.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <div>Thus, based on this collaboration in cybersecurity and governance, best practices and policy goals with the United Kingdom and the European Council on Cybercrime, South Africa’s new Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill was drafted. In response to this, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is also gearing itself towards this bill by sending its state attorneys and advocates on NQF6 and NQF8 Cybercrime courses.</div> <p> </p> <p> </p> <div>As it stands, many security experts have cautiously welcomed the new bill, stating concerns that privacy and constitutional rights may be infringed upon. Leading cybercrime expert, Professor Basie von Solms, states it is still “a step in the right direction,” even though “there were issues that had to be addressed.”<br /> <br /> It has become increasingly clear that in order to fight cybercrime and stay current in all matters relating to cybersecurity, South Africa will have to partner with other countries, businesses, organisations and most important of all, local ICT companies.  </div> <p> </p> <div> </div> <div>As software engineers, we must work with government in order to guide it on all the technical aspects of cybercrime and cybersecurity in order to help them to understand and implement the correct legislation by considering the moral, ethical and legal aspects relating to IT. It is the duty and responsibility of the private sector to comment on laws that apply directly to it. After all, what is the point of the new legislation if there is no one to enforce it, and no one from the IT sector to assist government in implementing it?</div>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Christoff Smith (Senior Software Engineer: Entelect Software)<br/><br/> In today’s fast-moving world, technological advances happen faster than legislation can keep up, and will continue to do so for many years to come. As software engineers, the onus lies on us, not only to apply ethical behaviour to the implementation of these new technologies but also to enforce cybersecurity. This can be accomplished only if software companies liaise with governments to enforce new legislation that protects a country’s citizens from falling victim to cybercrimes relating to new technologies.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Next level analytics competency – part two</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two aspects to analytics: technical and capabilities. Firstly, you need to be able to get the data and visualise it – this is the technical side of analytics. You then need to know what to look for – this is the capabilities aspect.</p> <p>Before we can understand the capabilities side of analytics, we need to grasp the technical aspect. Today, there is a whole host of Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) available to the general public, including <a href="https://www.edx.org" target="_blank">EDX</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Corsera</a> and <a href="http://bigdatauniversity.com" target="_blank">BigDataUniversity</a>. These MOOCs provide a wide variety of free and paid-for courses that can assist people in developing their talent and enabling them to reach their analytics capability. Another option is to pick up some technologies and give them a try. Most new technologies for data analytics are very intuitive and do not require a massive amount of technical ability to get out a proof of concept. For example, <a href="http://nodexl.codeplex.com" target="_blank">NodeXL</a> is a great Excel plugin that you can use to quickly get out social media statistics, while <a href="http://www.tableau.com" target="_blank">Tableau</a> and <a href="http://www.qlik.com/404?item=%2fexplore%2fproducts%2fsense&user=extranet%5cAnonymous&site=Qlik" target="_blank">Qliksense</a> both provide a useful desktop platform to connect to data sources and quickly create a data discovery dashboard. IBM’s <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/what-is-watson.html" target="_blank">Watson</a> is also an option. If you want a lightweight cloud version that you can throw some data at and get some great insights, it is quite affordable. </p> <p> So who do we hire in the new world of analytics? The technologies we are using are far too young for someone to be an expert in them. When I’m hiring people for a relatively new technology stack, I like to look at the person’s online profile: does he or she have a blog that is respected within the community; has he or she published articles; what is his or her status on forums? In the interview, I try to gauge the applicant’s passion for data and analytics. Because the technologies are so young, I look for a pseudo track record that will provide confidence in abilities and not necessarily a commercial track record.</p> <p>When you are looking to outsource certain components of your analytics strategy, use the same methodology for the service provider’s staff. Public profile, transparent training programmes and track records are key when it comes to bleeding-edge technologies.</p> <p>In terms of developing people in the realm of analytics, not the technical side, there is no hard-and- fast method for this. My best advice is to read as many industry case studies as possible, keep up to date with global trends within your sector, and try to use some of this learning to apply internally. Many people outside of your organisation are investing a lot of money into these case studies and it’s an easy win. I also try to read relevant research papers from Masters and PhD students from around the world.</p> <p>The one point I must stress is that locally relevant domain knowledge is crucial. Understanding the industry and business is a critical component to achieving analytics success. I have mentioned this before but I always look for the ‘Miss Congenialities’ of organisations. These people have been at the company for many years, worked in several departments and are likely to have more domain knowledge than most. Always try to leverage these people when going down your analytics journey.</p> <p>From a capabilities point of view, there are two additional key points organisations need to take into account. Firstly, the relationships with external parties, which include vendors, suppliers and universities. These people are paid to keep up to date with industry trends, research what the next big thing is and are more than willing to share that knowledge. <br /> Universities in particular are great channels for assisting with analytics capabilities because their research departments are on the cutting edge of what is coming next. They are also in need of corporate sponsorship. Many graduates are doing great work and are worth talking to about ideas you may have to take your organisation to the next level. </p> <p>The second point is to ‘invest time in wasting time’. This is one of the most important things you can do to keep yourself abreast of what is going on in the world of data analytics. Gather a team and sit and watch YouTube videos for an hour or two on relevant technologies/topics, spend time reading the case studies and just talking about possibilities and ideas.</p> <p>In the<a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=53151" target="_blank"> third</a> and final part of this series, I will look at the best case structure for a high performing analytics strategy.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Next level analytics competency – part three</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each company has its own unique culture and this drives how things are done in the organisation. To transform analytics, make sure you are out of your comfort zone – we cannot stick to the same way of doing things as we have done in the past. Make sure innovation is encouraged and incentivised. Support from an executive within the company is also crucial.</p> <p>Transforming technology is a longer process. Companies have to be open to embracing new technologies and allowing rogue analytics to occur. Forget about governance (to a certain extent, of course) because organisations need to encourage playing around with new technologies and they should not wrap up the process in red tape. Lastly, and good news, the new technologies are not that expensive.</p> <p>From a capabilities point of view, embrace the online courses available and form strategic partners with vendors, suppliers and universities because these are the people who will assist you in getting the most out of your efforts. Remember to invest time in wasting time – watch YouTube videos, read case studies and keep up to date with industry and global analytics trends.</p> <p>I believe that every organisation needs an analytics steerco. This committee should be made up of people who are both internal and external to the organisation. There should be an internal executive who chairs the meetings. It is also necessary that all business units are represented in this steerco. From an external point of view, technology vendors, outsourced suppliers as well as students from local universities should be included. With a team of the above individuals, an organisation should quickly be able to identify a strategy of analytics that will target small pockets of work that can prove a concept and show a value add. </p> <p>Once the steerco is set up, an analytics centre of excellence is needed. This should comprise of people who are passionate about technology and analytics. These people will be responsible for executing the ideas that are put forward by the analytics steerco. This is by no means a full time role, once the analytics strategy is solidified it will, however, warrant the dedicated resources. <br /> <br /> To summarise, let’s take a look at the process for an analytics Utopia within an organisation. Firstly, there needs to be an executive heading up the entire process. The analytics steerco is tasked with meeting monthly to determine what questions are going to drive the strategy. The steerco then hands the ideas to the analytics centre of excellence, which executes the ideas and gives feedback to the steerco. If an idea is deemed to be valuable, the centre of excellence hands this to the internal BI/MIS team, which then formalises the new analytics. The BI/MIS team implements the correct data governance, adds it to existing structures and automates the processes with the relevant visualisations. This is then exposed to the business and the cycle starts again.<br /> <br /> All of these steps require weekly progress updates, monthly meetings as well as a huge emphasis on change management. Business users need to understand what value the new analytics will bring to the table, when it is going to be implemented and how it will impact the day to day running of the business.<br /> <br /> All in all, the conference was successful and I’m sure everyone who was there, took away something from the conference that they could implement within their organisations. We are in an extremely exciting time, with everyone racing to be excellent at analytics and provide a better experience for customers, staff and ultimately, their organisations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Delivering a quality service – getting it right</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many mechanisms available to support a company’s service-delivery goals and effective implementation of these may be critical in achieving those goals. They include technology and systems, standard operating procedures, industry best practices and standards body certifications.However, many companies neglect to recognise the impact of the softer elements of service delivery: the human element.</p> <p> </p> <p>Interpersonal relationships can take a mediocre experience and turn it into something exceptional. People like to do business with those whom they trust and trust is an emotional response to a positive (or negative) experience with another individual. Having all the checks and balances in place cannot guarantee a positive outcome if interaction at a personal level isn’t taken care of effectively.<br /> <br /> The obvious answer to this is to hire the right people but this doesn’t really tell us much. If competence is assured, what are some of the key behavioural characteristics of individuals required to deliver a quality service?</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Show a sense of urgency</strong></p> <p>Clients want to know that you are taking them seriously. This can best be done by showing a sense of urgency, which means understanding and acknowledging their requests or concerns, acting immediately and providing regular feedback.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Be reliable</strong></p> <p>Reliability is a requirement for trust. Building strong relationships requires us to honour our commitments, whether made in passing conversation or as part of a larger project plan. Simple things, such as not returning a phone call when promised, not arriving for a meeting and lack of attention to detail resulting in a rework, can erode the trust in relationship. If you can’t honour a commitment, then explain the circumstances, provide alternatives and present a revised plan of action that is agreeable to all parties. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Be objective</strong></p> <p>Emotional biases are typically triggered by our past experiences or when challenged. They may result in being defensive, sugar coating or making unreasonable promises that can’t be kept. Do not let emotional biases get in the way of presenting information. Always present the facts as you understand them, then, and only if asked or obliged, provide your opinion based on the facts. As professionals, we owe it to our clients to first present factual information, irrespective of how we feel about a particular situation.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Communicate frequently</strong></p> <p>When it comes to delivering a quality service, keep all those involved in the project informed with regular and frequent communication. This reiterates a ‘sense of urgency’ and shows that your client’s requirements are a priority.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Value over ego</strong></p> <p>Be humble in your interactions with a client and spend more time listening than talking. This opens the door for a better understanding of their needs and builds a stronger interpersonal relationship, which, in turn, builds more trust. Going into a discussion hoping to learn something rather than teach something, ultimately positions you to provide more value to your client’s business in the long-term.</p> <p> </p> <p>Those businesses that continue to prioritise technology and processes over the human element to address service delivery goals will always fall short of delivering a quality service to their clients. Assuming you have a solid product and the ability to complete the job, it is the quality of the interpersonal experiences that leave a lasting impression and build a better relationship. </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Doug Crawford (Entelect Manager: Service Delivery) <br/><br/> Delivering a quality service can make or break a business, especially those in the professional services space where the product is the service. The level of service provided to clients can become a key differentiator and, more often than not, determines whether a client will partner with a service provider for the long-term or, at a minimum, refer the service provider to other potential clients.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Adaptation in software development processes: Learn, detach and transcend.</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of building software, best practices are considered a field-proven technique for solving a known problem. They should be a guide. A mechanism that sets boundaries and establishes clear roles, process and measurements. As software professionals, we want these processes, practices and methodologies to tell us how to get big teams to work together effectively, how to measure (and report) progress and how to collectively deliver great quality software. This sounds right, however, best practices should not be used as a prescriptive, singular approach. At some point, every problem becomes unique and common sense offers additional value. </p> <p> </p> <p>Voltaire famously said in 1764 that “Common sense is not so common”. This just indicates that we can’t rely on common sense to make decisions as perspectives are not always shared. Instead, we should foster a shared understanding, a consensus on a position and perception which allows groups of people to reach the same conclusion.</p> <p> </p> <p>Looking at the two concepts, there is a clear relationship. It seems that we go about creating and documenting practices in this endless desire to pen down common sense, to articulate things that we often feel are obvious with retrospect, the Agile revolution is a stand-out example of this. Perhaps the real goal is to know how to sequence and blend practices to service a specific software development scenario - a cocktail of experience, maturity, structure, influence and intent.</p> <p> </p> <p>I’m regularly confronted by frustrated software engineers who are baffled by the seeming absence of common sense being applied in their development environments. The frustration of engineers and development managers share an interesting degree of overlap. The developer is confused at either the lack or excess of process, and the development manager is frustrated at the lack of adoption of the processes, or the uncertainty of which process to use. Dealing with these situations takes some insight.</p> <p> </p> <p>I like to think of best practices, or strict methodologies as a set of rules to get you going. First we need to learn and master these rules and their application, this is experience, thereafter we can experiment. An opinion with experience carries a lot more weight. People aren't naturally good at using common sense in complex and quickly developing areas, so it feels intuitive to start with a documented approach, and not rely on our own individual sense.</p> <p> </p> <p>Intention is also important. Identify the actual objective of the practice. For example, a strict process that govern changes to a software product could feel encumbered and unnecessary, but the intention is to protect the company and the users, which makes sense. In this example my argument would be to first master the process, and prove beyond a doubt that you’re capable of adhering to it, and then start a process of change from your position of proven knowledge.  </p> <p> </p> <p>With the application of experience and mastery, we can know when and how to break, or evolve, the rules to better suit the people, the product or the objectives. This is the ‘common sense’ many will rush to claim prematurely.</p> <p> </p> <p>Given this understanding, it stands to reason that industries current set of best practices are the combination of experience from experts who have come before us, but also that once we reach a level of experience and mastery, our own common sense can inspire adaptation.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>There is a Japanese martial arts concept called ‘Shuhari’ which roughly translates to “first learn, then detach, and finally transcend” which is an enlightening approach to developing best practice that is relevant every time.</p> <p> </p> <p>At Entelect we’re constantly selecting, applying and measuring development practices to find what works. As engineers, processes are important to us and the development of rules helps streamline problem-solving to some degree. But that doesn’t mean we operate SCRUM by-the-book on every project. Every problem really is unique, mostly because of the people! Part of successfully applying best practice requires establishing a consensus on a position and perception between development managers and engineers. At which point, the team can ‘learn, detach and transcend’ and the resulting application of common sense can add real value to best practice solutions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Anyone can code, but there are no short cuts to true success.</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>Today, just about anything can be learnt via the internet, enabling people all over the world the chance to develop skills in virtually any field. Considering the fast growth of the technology industry, this presents exciting opportunities; placing opportunity in the hands of anyone dedicated to learning a new skill. As such, the rock stars of today are no longer traditional jocks, they are geeks with laptops.</p> <p> </p> <p>This shift is even more relevant in the software industry. Anyone technically inclined can learn how to write software if they spend enough time on Google. And with a keen eye for innovation, anyone can come up with a great concept that has the potential to disrupt life the way Facebook did.</p> <p> </p> <p>No doubt, there have been some truly amazing software solutions built in this informal fashion, but the difference between a great concept and a beautifully built piece of software that complies with best practices and quality standards, is a lot of hard work.</p> <p> </p> <p>The media and Silicon Valley glamorize stories of the ‘lone genius coder’, those superstars depicted in films such as The Social Network and Mr. Robot. But the truth is, there is no shortcut to building great software.</p> <p> </p> <p>Like any industry, there are isolated geniuses who build out products that fundamentally disrupt our lives. But, like football millionaires and music artists, these stories are exceptional and are only a fraction of the people who contribute to their industries. Silicon Valley for example, employs only 8% of coders in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/">US</a>.      </p> <p> </p> <p>So, what does the bigger picture look like? For starters, while many coders and engineers across the world are self-taught, most have had formalized training behind them.</p> <p> </p> <p>Secondly, most software engineers in the industry build out products that answer a business need. Many work for businesses, big or small, or consultancies where a large part of the job is helping to identify the problem and best fit solution.</p> <p> </p> <p>Do they receive the same glory and recognition on the global stage? No. But often the solutions that engineers develop to resolve various challenges provide a greater sense of purpose.</p> <p> </p> <p>As traditional industries shift towards technology solutions, engineers can find themselves working to build time-effective, secure banking solutions that help make your day-to-day life easier; or healthcare solutions that help people identify early onset of diseases, or agriculture solutions that help farmers monitor the health of their crop or livestock.</p> <p> </p> <p>Often these are small shifts, but they can have a dramatic impact on the livelihoods of the communities around us.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, within these environments there can be inconsistencies between the capabilities of those software engineers with formalized or non-formalized training. Not every company requires a graduate degree for example. Equally, even within academia, there can be discrepancies regarding the different levels of practical experience obtained, making a significant difference to the engineers’ ability to build the right solution for the problem at hand.</p> <p> </p> <p>When building software, engineers need to consider issues such as maintainability, quality, stability, performance, consistent standards, security, and scalability. To build a perfect solution requires the engineer to do all these things in parallel, which is true craftsmanship and takes years of experience.  It requires significant thought to be applied to the architecture and design, the ability to apply computer science principles (such as OO), and a strong problem solving ability. As such, mastering the skills required to deliver great software is a highly adapted talent.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect understands the complexities of todays’ business challenges in software engineering, and this has informed our hiring strategy. We believe that a degree in Information Technology, Engineering or Mathematics equips a prospective candidate with the foundation required to become a great software engineer.</p> <p> </p> <p>For our graduates, we build on their academic learning with an intensive 6 week graduate bootcamp to convert the academic learning into practical real-world experience. We then invest heavily in continued training to ensure all our staff are constantly at the forefront of software engineering trends and best practices.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately, however, in South Africa the software engineering field is predominately unregulated. Compared to traditional engineering disciplines and law, there are a lack of governing bodies and professional organisations. This makes it harder for potential clients or employers to spot the average coders from outstanding talent.</p> <p> </p> <p>While this is improving globally, we are in the midst of a societal shift towards citizen-driven access to knowledge that is up-ending our traditional regulatory systems. Legislation needs to understand how to work with these shifts and apply quality controls accordingly, but this will take time.</p> <p> </p> <p>That anyone can teach themselves to code via google is fantastic. It gives this growing industry a low barrier to entry, making it inclusive and meaning that anyone can discover their potential. However, transitioning from a self-taught coder to a software engineer capable of true craftsmanship takes years of experience and formalized training.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you’re determined to become a superstar coder, then you should commit to continued learning including some formalized training and understand that there are no short cuts, just a lot of hard work and true dedication to your craft. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Building a high impact leadership development framework</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Globally, companies spend millions on formal Leadership Development initiatives to try and fast track and invest in their leadership pipeline. A typical Harvard Business School Executive Leadership Development Program can easily cost in excess of $40 000, with local programs being a bit more affordable, ranging from R60 000 for short courses to an excess of R300 000 for executive focused programmes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Irrespective of the type of programme, they all have a common goal in mind: to develop the next set of leaders inside our organisations. However, we sometimes miss the mark by not delivering a good balance between targeted outcomes compared to the amount of time, effort and money put in.</p> <p> </p> <p>In other words we are not getting the needed bang for our buck. But there are some common mistakes we make when starting these initiatives:</p> <p>1) Failing to properly define expected ROI metrics and later benchmarking against them.</p> <p>2) Failing to select the correct programme, course or service provider that fits the current needs, goals and culture of the organisation.</p> <p>3) Not selecting the right attendees.</p> <p> </p> <p>As we all know, there are no shortcuts to developing our staff, be it technical development or leadership development. What we need is a well thought through approach that will help us navigate the dynamic world of business.</p> <p> </p> <p>Time, effort, commitment and follow through:</p> <p>Form a managerial level, we need to spend time and effort to take stock of what our organisational needs are. For example, do we prioritise technical skills over leadership skills? Do we get an external service provider to present new content or, do we develop our own?</p> <p>We need to commit to our training and development initiatives as part of a continual learning process. We do this by actively managing expectations and actual outcomes.</p> <p>Finally, we need follow through. We need to measure, assess and be able to illustrate the true impact the program has had, not only on the organisation as a whole, but specifically on the individual. That is ultimately our goal, improving the individual.</p> <p> </p> <p>A framework:</p> <p>To help you structure your skills, and leadership development programmes it is worth thinking of it in terms of a hierarchy of needs. Different groups of employees have different needs, at different times of their careers, where each layer supports and builds up to the next layer.</p> <p> </p> <p>A typical hierarchy of needs triangle can illustrate how you could structure some of your initiatives to achieve maximum impact. Each level targets a specific need or group in the business, and will be tailored accordingly.</p> <p>1. Culture and Values: As a starting point the cultural elements as well as the core values of the organisation needs to be defined, communicated and regularly reinforced. One of the many functions of this layer is to set and communicate your commitment to caring for and growing your staff. Initiatives in this layer can be broader in focus and can be targeted to larger groups within the organisation.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. The Core Technical Competencies layer focusses on equipping your staff with the needed skills and knowledge to be able to effectively perform their duties. In other words, your staff needs to have the ability to perform per the expected standard of excellence. Training programs that fall into this layer, should have a direct impact on the daily operations of the business.</p> <p> </p> <p>3.The Technical Specialities layer focusses on the specialist skillsets that will help drive your business forward, ensuring that:</p> <p>It remains relevant in the market place in terms of technical capability (such as technology changes, competition, client demands).</p> <p>It can take on new opportunities that arise over time as result of a changing market conditions (such as emerging technologies, new markets).</p> <p>It can differentiate itself from its competitors (via niche or specialist skills)</p> <p> </p> <p>4. New Leadership Development focusses on developing new leaders and helping them transition from technical experts into leaders in your organisation. This is especially difficult to achieve, especially in strong technical environments where a lot of value and status is assigned to your technical and specialist ability as an individual. What is important to note, and incorporate,  into initiatives for this layer is the differentiation between technical ability and leadership ability as distinct disciplines.</p> <p>Initiatives in this layer are less broad, and some specialisation needs to be done by identifying sub groups, such as inexperienced leaders vs experienced leaders.</p> <p> </p> <p>5. Targeted Leadership Development needs to ensure that you nurture and grow your key leaders in the organisation. What needs to be recognised is that just as you would mentor your staff on technical competencies, leaders need specific leadership focused mentorship in order to develop their leadership ability further.</p> <p>Research has shown that people who have been mentored by multiple mentors, have shown greater levels success than those who have only been mentored by a single mentor.</p> <p>Initiatives in this layer needs to be focused on the individual and tailored to their specific needs and situation. If they are group based, the groups must be smaller and individuals needs to be grouped according to their leadership development needs.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ultimately, the outcomes and impact of training and development initiatives needs to be measurable and illustratable to be able to assess the value of the amount of time, effort and money put in. But similarly, the appropriate selection and ‘fit’ of employees to each training course is important. You need to ensure that the initiative will cater to the needs of the specific group or person, and that the expected outcomes will match your goals for the organisation.</p> <p> </p> <p>By applying our minds and defining a structured approach to how we implement our training leadership development initiatives we can start the journey of not only caring for, and growing our staff more effectively, but also delivering true value to the organisation without blowing the budget.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>A case for unpleasant design in software development</title>

              <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of software development, user experience (UX) design is a hot topic.</p> <p>Research has shown that UX design can significantly enhance the customer experience, by focusing design efforts on improving usability, accessibility and the user journey. In the age of mobile, the user’s experience can have a huge impact on whether your app will be a success or failure: the difference between millions of downloads and none.</p> <p>I recently listened to a podcast about ‘Hostile Architecture’ and started thinking about how we can employ this concept in shaping users’ behaviour; pushing them away from certain behaviours and towards others.</p> <p>Let’s have a look at what is meant by ‘Hostile Architecture’, also known as ‘unpleasant design’. In architecture, unpleasant design has manifested itself in a wide variety of areas.</p> <p>Here are some common examples:</p> <ul> <li>Using metal spikes or protrusions to prevent people from sitting or sleeping on sidewalks and in front of shop windows</li> <li>Designing seats in a way that prevents people from sitting comfortably for long periods, such as at bus and train stations</li> <li>At airports, arm rests are designed in a way that prevents people from lying down, forcing them to sit, straight up, knees facing forward – not the most comfortable position for a wary traveller!</li> <li>The use of pink lighting outside shops accentuates skin blemishes and therefore discourages teenagers from congregating outside</li> <li>The use of ultraviolet lighting under city bridges and in public restrooms makes it difficult for drug users to locate their veins to inject drugs</li> </ul> <p>What’s important to note is that, in all these examples, the core problem was not resolved, but rather shifted. It forced vagrants to find other places to sit or sleep, teenagers to find other spots to congregate at, that didn’t highlight their, well, spots. Drug users were forced to find other places to get high.</p> <p>The point is that unpleasant design is meant to deter or frustrate the user to such an extent that the undesirable behaviour is either ceased or displaced.</p> <p><strong>So how do we apply this to UX design?</strong></p> <p>Typically, if you wanted to change your users’ behaviours, you probably wouldn’t opt to frustrate them. You might argue that you would rather use an incentive model to elicit the desired behavioural change. However, there are a few examples where unpleasant design might come in handy, such as in fraud prevention and monitoring.</p> <p>As part of bigger enterprise-level systems, some activities are considered higher risk than others. For instance, users of a payments administration platform might be able to update or change a creditor’s banking details. By manipulating these details, payments could potentially be funnelled away from the intended recipient into a fraudster’s account. If details are changed back after a payment has been processed, and in the absence of proper control mechanisms, the fraud could go undetected.</p> <p>Let’s assume that all the typical control mechanisms and processes are in place to prevent fraud but that there are functions on the system that are vulnerable to abuse.</p> <p><strong>How do we design a system that highlights and actively discourages these high-risk actions?</strong></p> <p>One approach could be to apply the concept of unpleasant design, with the purpose of deterring or frustrating the user to avoid certain undesirable or high-risk behaviours. For example, the high-risk behaviour on the system is highlighted by making the typical audit trail data visible to the users. By doing this, the user is made acutely aware of his actions and behaviour on the system, as well as the fact that this behaviour is being tracked and monitored. And so, you rely on the resulting psychological effect as the deterrent: the fear of being caught.</p> <p><strong>Understanding your client and their business</strong></p> <p>Software engineers need to constantly look for ideas and find inspiration from other environments and industries to help drive innovation and rejuvenate our way of thinking about how we design and build systems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Jaco Grant (Entelect, Delivery Manager) <br><br> UX design can significantly enhance customer experience. But recently a slightly unconventional approach known as 'hostile architecture’ is being used to shape consumer behaviour. So, how can you apply this to UX design effectively?]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Let’s do Agile right</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agile is an approach that companies must be prepared to live, breathe and consistently practise to realise the full value of the methodology. This means full buy-in and in most instances, a mind-shift across the entire organisation. Add the rapid pace of industry caused by the Digital Age, it’s easy to see why every organisation needs a software development workforce to stay up-to-date and competitive.</p> <p> </p> <p>Traditional product development lifecycles just don’t cut it anymore. These processes can delay a great idea by 12 months, meaning your organisation quickly loses its position against it competitors.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Agile methodology was designed to help organisations respond more efficiently in a dynamic market environment. But there are critical success factors to Agile. If you don’t adhere to these, then you’re probably not seeing the benefits and wondering what all the fuss is about. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to do Agile right?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>1. To do Agile ‘right’, requires the organisation to foster a culture of innovation. Agile creates a ‘start-up’ vibe, which inspires employees. It is widely understood that a great idea can come from any facet of a business, and most certainly from any employee. Challenging the status quo is a characteristic that is at the heart of Agile. An organisation that encourages its employees to constantly challenge the status quo is going to inspire innovative thinking as part of its culture.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. The team structure is critical. It’s the responsibility of the product owner in an Agile squad to ensure that the right people are in the right seat. A squad normally comprises of the following roles:</p> <p>• Product owner</p> <p>• Scrum master</p> <p>• Technical lead </p> <p>• Squad members (developers, designers, testers, data analysts and analysts)</p> <p> </p> <p>The squad should then be supported by a scrum coach, engineering coach, and people coach. Coaches may seem like an unnecessary second layer but the coaches are essential. They are there to support, guide, and teach the tools and principles for successful Agile implementation. Without them, your squad will not have the benefit of previous experience.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Provide plenty of training. The dynamic nature of Agile means that teams must be constantly learning, evolving and adapting. Teams need a vast array of skills and experience to deliver on an Agile project. It is important to equip the squad with the necessary skills and knowledge to make the correct calls. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Why Agile goes wrong?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>There are several reasons Agile in organisations fails before it gets going. Often it is the lack of simple but essential team features.</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Autonomy. The product owner doesn’t allow or encourage autonomy in the squad. The squad must be encouraged to make decisions and consequently take ownership. Only when people feel a sense of ownership can they have the greatest impact on a project.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. The scrum master must sustain performance. When scrum masters don’t drive performance, or demonstrate any creativity to improve team dynamics, communication breaks down and this ultimately breaks the quality and culture in the squad.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Compiling a team with the wrong skills. In a bid to get an Agile team in place, corporates often compile a squad without the right complement of skills and expertise. The result is that the team falls back into its old habits.</p> <p> </p> <p>4. The product must be designed, spec’d and estimated before it is passed to the Agile squad to build. Thereby fitting a waterfall project into an Agile development drive train, but not allowing Agile methodology to build the product as you go.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to start Agile in a corporate?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>A top-down approach is always the best place to start. No doubt that buy-in from executives and senior management really help to cement a new approach.</p> <p> </p> <p>Hire smart. Ensure you have the correct people with the correct skills on the team. Importantly, make sure you have a Scrum master who can keep the team running on a solid, even, and efficient pace. This person must be the heartbeat of the team.</p> <p> </p> <p>Start with a fresh project with minimal dependencies. This will allow you to experience the strength of doing Agile ‘right’, and doing it right first time will give you a solid base for your next Agile project.</p> <p> </p> <p>Don’t forget to look after your people. The environment, having the right tools for the job – and plenty of coffee - all play a big part. The team must be exceptionally cohesive.</p> <p> </p> <p>Finally, be committed to the process. The ship turns slowly at first, but keep it turning and your business will find a pace that will allow it to be more dynamic than its competitors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Developing a natural interest in STEM through open source software</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During another power cut in a poor area of Brazil, a mechanic sat in the dark and wondered how he could light up his house without electricity. He came up with the idea of pouring bleach and water into a two-litre plastic bottle, which refracted sunlight through a hole in the roof and lit up his house during the day.</p> <p> </p> <p>Alfredo Moser’s invention has provided a simple lighting solution to millions of people who live in off-grid areas around the world. Others have since improved on his design, by attaching solar panels so that it can also provide light at night-time.</p> <p> </p> <p>This is a real-world example of the value and beauty of open source design, more commonly spoken about in the context of software development.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Greater good</strong></p> <p>Designers, inventors and engineers put their ideas out into the world in the hopes that they will inspire others to improve on their designs and create something that we can’t live without. Open source collaboration works so well because the community is committed to making every iteration better and more secure than the last. They take pride in what they do and work together to produce high-quality solutions.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>They’ve gotten it right in the software space</strong></p> <p>A few years ago, proprietary business and creative software was prohibitively expensive for many people. But the unstoppable rise of the open source movement has democratised software and information to the point where – no matter what type of software you need – it’s likely you’ll find a free, high quality and substantially cheaper alternative to the top-of-the-range, paid-for options.</p> <p> </p> <p>Even enterprises are increasingly putting their trust in open source software, like Apache, Linux and MySQL, and the big guys, like Microsoft, are releasing a lot of their source code to open source platforms.</p> <p> </p> <p>Many of us don’t actually realise how much open source software we use every day – or the impact these solutions have had on our lives. If you watch videos through VLC Media Player, you’re using open source software. If you use Mozilla as an email or web browsing client, you’re using open source software. If you use GIMP to edit images or Drupal to build websites – you get the point.</p> <p> </p> <p>Now imagine the impact of equally high quality education software in the lives of children in rural or under-resourced areas. Imagine the difference in learning outcomes between children studying out of outdated, dog-eared textbooks, versus engaging with world-class, interactive and relevant digital content that immerses learners in topics that excite them, rather than imposing structured, predetermined and – let’s face it – boring curricula on them just because that’s the way it’s always been done.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>A new, effective approach to STEM</strong></p> <p>This is how we’ll get children interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) – effortlessly and effectively. Not by lowering pass rates or making these subjects optional in schools. The truth is, if we keep teaching STEM subjects the way we always have, children will never be excited about them. But let them tinker around with IoT and the free resources on sites like Wyliodrin Studio, or encourage them to contribute to the open source projects on Village Science, and watch a love of STEM develop naturally.</p> <p> </p> <p>When we remove the barriers to e-learning; when we let children do what they love to do – tinker with gadgets, learn through games, share ideas with friends – they’ll become interested in STEM without us even trying.</p> <p> </p> <p>And the onus is no longer on teachers to be subject matter experts. With e-learning, teachers become facilitators of the learning process, helping children to find their passions and encouraging them to delve deeper, to teach themselves a new skill, to learn how to make something with their hands. That’s probably the best definition of teaching there is.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this context, learning becomes addictive because there are no boundaries, no mandated content; just free access to a world of knowledge. Imagine the impact of that. Imagine what happens when we give children the opportunity to become the next generation of open source coders, tinkerers and collaborators on the next world-impacting or life-changing invention.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p> <p>Low-cost computing solutions like the Raspberry Pi* make it more affordable than ever to set up computer labs in schools. By simply plugging in a monitor and keyboard, you instantly have a fully working computer on which children can learn programming to build anything they want.</p> <p> </p> <p>The debate around STEM needs to change from how to get children interested (because they already are) to how to facilitate the deployment of these software and hardware solutions in schools.</p> <p> </p> <p>Connectivity is still the biggest stumbling block. While e-learning can certainly be delivered without connectivity – through preloaded content – learning truly comes alive when children are able to define their own learning journeys and access the tomes of free content that will help them to shape their ideas.</p> <p> </p> <p>Connectivity is maturing in the country, with the roll-out of fibre-to-the-home and the government’s drive to bring down data costs. This is where we should be placing our attention in the STEM debate: to get more people online in support of the idea that connectivity is a basic human right.</p> <p> </p> <p>Everything else is semantics: software is free, hardware is affordable, the interest is there. Open source software has revolutionised every other aspect of our lives and businesses, yet it’s only trickling into the education system, where it arguably should be implemented with the most fervour because our children will be the next innovators, tinkerers and world-changers. It’s our responsibility to give them the tools and information that will open their minds and spark their creativity.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Recovering from failure</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>Some say that between 45% to 55% of IT projects fail. Others also say that 80% of statistics are made up on the spot, or is it 75%?</p> <p> </p> <p>Irrespective of how many projects fail the important thing to realize is, they do fail. Failure is a relative term, and can be varied in scope, intensity and consequence. Some projects run over resource or time constraints with marginal consequence, others fail miserably with disastrous consequences.</p> <p> </p> <p>In 1999, NASA lost one of its $129-Million Mars Orbiters due to a seemingly obvious problem and mistake. The problem being the conversion from inches, feet and pounds to millimeters, meters and kilograms, with the quite disastrous mistake being that it wasn’t being converted at all.</p> <p> </p> <p>As it turns out the two teams working on the project, NASA’s JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Lockheed Martin were using the different measurement systems for their respective calculations. The result being that after its 286-day journey to Mars, the Orbiter initiated and engine burn to push itself into its final orbit around Mars. Due to the unit mismatch, it pushed the orbiter 25 km closer to the atmosphere than it should have. Subsequently things got worse, the engine overheated, turned itself off and ultimately the orbiter shot through the upper Mars atmosphere, popping out the other side, sending it outwards into space. Presumably to ‘where no man has gone before’.</p> <p> </p> <p>For us in the enterprise software development space, the consequence of failure isn’t quite as extreme as was the case for the Mars orbiter, but stakes are still pretty high in terms of delivering feature rich, high quality software solutions to our clients. There is the obvious financial impact of failed projects, but most importantly there is a huge loss-of-opportunity cost. This can range from a basic loss of income caused by not being able to capitalize on your ideas or initiatives, to making bad business decisions by not having sufficient insight into your own business data. Bad decisions can cost you your business.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Failure</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>So, when things do go wrong and don’t work out as expected; what then?</p> <p> </p> <p>Well, depending of the severity of the failure, your first action might be to Google The Seven Stages of Grief (Shock, Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Testing, Acceptance). And then you realize that ironically a lack of Testing and Acceptance is probably what got you into this mess in the first place!</p> <p> </p> <p>Then as the shock fades you turn your attention back to the task at hand. What now?</p> <p> </p> <p>As a start, it is to be expected that your client will most probably be very angry and may need an outlet to vent their frustration. Don’t see this as a negative aspect of the experience. The important point to note here is to listen and show the client that you care, not that you are just sympathetic, but that you are deeply empathetic as to what has transpired.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Own your mistakes</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>By building meaningful relationships with your clients, it will create room for experimentation and ultimately create tolerance for mistakes. It is important to own your mistakes and to never underestimate the value of saying you are sorry.</p> <p> </p> <p>Consider all the information at hand before responding to your client’s view point and frustrations. It is important to take stock and assess what when wrong. Most of the time it is not a single factor, but a series of factors and events that culminates into a crisis. It is important the translate this into a learning experience for both yourself, your team and even your client.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Never waste a good crisis</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>This will naturally lead you into a space where you can start the recovery process, for both yourself and your client. This is the stage where you start fighting your way back and winning back some of the trust that may have been lost. You need to research, plan, negotiate and work your way back. This is where you show what you are made of, you need to commit time, resources and potentially money to work towards your planned goals of recovery.</p> <p> </p> <p>Some challenges along the way will include winning back enough trust from the client to allow you room to execute your recovery plan. You will need to keep your team motivated throughout, keeping them committed to the end goal. This is where you will learn a lot about the people you are working with and you will come to see the qualities that are needed in a strong team; courage, resolve and strength of character, in other words: Grit.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Failure equals opportunity</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>In conclusion, failure is sometimes inevitable, but over the span of your career you will become more skilled at managing that risk, becoming better at foreseeing and preempting failures. The important part is to know that in the face of failure, there are a multitude of opportunities to seize, you just need the courage to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Kicking off the first squad</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>When our squad started the engagement with our client, it was August 2016.</p> <p> </p> <p>We had to deliver an MVP in 16 weeks. This included client interviews, story mapping with UX designs, setup of the delivery pipeline for the squad, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, deployments, identifying and implementing communication channels such as Slack, with integrations into the delivery pipeline.</p> <p> </p> <p>The first squad is always the hardest.</p> <p> </p> <p>Overtime is required, there are many internal walls that need to be broken down, and internal business processes require adjustment for Agile delivery. Business will require quick feedback and they want to see value within the first 2 sprints… the pressure was on.</p> <p> </p> <p>We knew this going in though. We also knew that for any squad to be successful, the market research and discovery phase in sprint zero is vitally important.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The importance of sprint 0</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The discovery phase defines the MVP and the feature pipeline which sets the roadmap for the squad. What we built had to be tangible, achievable, disruptive and attractive to business.</p> <p> </p> <p>The discovery phase (Sprint 0) sets the tone for the team and is usually the hardest to show value. Most of the work done in sprint 0 doesn’t have much of a tangible value to it, so we knew it would be important to show the experience. Make it visible.</p> <p> </p> <p>An outcome of sprint 0 is to have the work aligned for the first 2 sprints. All the stories should be groomed, any designs should be done by the UX designer, so that the squad can kick-off the development with ease. It sets the standard for working in an Agile manner.</p> <p> </p> <p>While the discovery phase didn’t need the full squad, we made sure we had a representative from each of the core skillsets to cover all possible bases from the get-go.  These included:</p> <p> </p> <p>• Business (the Product Owner)</p> <p>• Analysts (to assist with the design, user story grooming, client interviews and environment analysis)</p> <p>• UX Designer (to analyze the customer journey and experience)</p> <p>• Engineers (to kick-off with the technical integrations, setting up of the CI/CD and delivery pipeline).</p> <p> </p> <p>Getting this team structure right upfront was vitally important to the developers and the success of the product. You can even throw in a small teambuilding exercise to ensure everyone knows each other and, to build culture.</p> <p> </p> <p>Once the discovery phase was complete, we’d defined the MVP, completed the User Story grooming, and laid out the first 2 to 3 sprints, we were ready to get the rest of the team to join in. And they hit the ground running.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Adjusting</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The 2nd squad kicked off after the first 16-week phase. We used the learning from the first squad to kick-start the 2nd team and drive the delivery from the start. The walls broken down by squad 1, allowed for an easier kick-off and start for the 2nd squad.</p> <p> </p> <p>Even after the 2nd squad had kicked off, we realized the biggest challenge would be to get the client business to adjust to an Agile methodology: to be more hands on and thoroughly invested in the processes, not just a by-stander overseeing the agile transformation. They needed to join the transformation and live and breathe agile it on a daily basis.</p> <p> </p> <p>To help client adjust would mean a very hands-on approach from our side.</p> <p> </p> <p>We invited the client to spend time within our dev squads, understanding why Agile was so important for building services and products in today’s market place. The hierarchy of the person is irrelevant. The important thing is for them to understand why it worked.</p> <p> </p> <p>Once we had buy-in and understanding, we were able to grow to six squads all compiled by Agile Coaches, Product Owners, Tech Leads, Software Engineers, Analysts, Data Scientists, UX Designers, UI designers, and Testers.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The stakes?</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Of course, there were risks. Any integration into legacy systems or existing applications that still run in waterfall delivery could affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the squad.</p> <p> </p> <p>But we were prepared for this. So, our approach was to tackle these dependencies upfront.</p> <p> </p> <p>It’s well understood that the first squad is tough. There are development and integration challenges, but also buy-in, and very often an organizational mind shift required to adopt Agile methodologies. </p> <p> </p> <p>One solution we worked with was to have one or two software engineers from other integration teams join the squad. This helped with knowledge sharing, IP, and buy-in where integrations and changes to existing services are needed. It also removed the old approach of ‘throwing work over the fence’ and waiting for feedback! 'Throwing work over the fence’ should be long gone, and banned from any custom development. The software vendor must build the software with the client, getting continuous feedback, and living the journey together.  That's why Entelect had such great success, because we formed a business partnership instead of the client/supplier relationship. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Things worth sharing</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Being people-focused; setting up career paths and performance appraisals that allow the engineers to grow and have short- or long-term targets for themselves is beneficial to the entire squad. Corporate reviews are just too restrictive, each member of the team needs their own defined path for growth.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Monthly check-ins between the scrum master and each person on the squad creates regular health checks and opportunities for mentoring.</p> <p> </p> <p>It’s also vital for squads to have the buy-in from an Executive or Director to open doors and remove any blockers that may be there. Organizational adjustment to Agile is a big deal and must be a team effort.</p> <p> </p> <p>Give the squad the freedom to be bold, to grow, and take chances, knowing that they will be accountable for the delivery as a squad. Make sure they see and get the support from business.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The next ‘first squad’? </strong></p> <p> </p> <p>It’ll be tough, they always are. But we’ll use everything we’ve learnt to refine, adapt, and take our client into an exciting new space for Agile development.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The importance of context in creating a good IA</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Samantha Winfield (Entelect, UX/UI Designer)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Context is important in all areas of design and can be a make or break factor. This is especially the case in information architecture. There are many techniques and methods used by UX designers to establish the information architecture for a product but overlooking something as important as context can mean the difference between a successful product and a failure.</p> <p> </p> <p>Consider the following statement:</p> <p> </p> <p>Ashley is running to the ball.</p> <p> </p> <p>What was the first idea that appeared in your mind? </p> <p> </p> <p>What if I were to tell you that Ashley was wearing a ball gown? Does that change your initial perception of the statement? What if I said Ashley was a professional rugby player or that she was a 5 year old playing with her friends in the street?</p> <p> </p> <p>Notice how the introduction of a small amount of extra information can completely change the meaning of the statement? Context refers to the who, what, where and when of a situation and provides us with important insights which influence our perception of that information. Without these insights, we are forced to make assumptions and come to our own bias conclusions about what a statement, object, or situation means. By setting the scene and providing context, we remove ambiguities, reduce the chances of assumptions and can therefore start relying on the correct interpretation and perception of information. </p> <p> </p> <p>In UX our main goal is to interact with users in order to remove biases and assumptions and create a product that our target market can use and interact with effectively. In this space, context is used to inform the user as to what something means and what to do next. Similarly, information architecture involves arranging the parts of a product to be understandable. Together, context and information architecture aim to achieve a similar goal: to guide the user to complete the necessary tasks effectively and efficiently.</p> <p> </p> <p>Building a solid foundation is critical to the user’s interaction with a product, therefore the information architecture should be carefully considered. UX designers typically use card sorting as the method of interacting with users to establish the information architecture. Card sorting involves presenting parts of the content for your product to the user as separate parts and asking them to group and categorise them.</p> <p>  </p> <p>Consider the simple example below:</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CardSorting1.png" style="width: 710px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>When given to a user in a card sorting exercise, the result may be similar to the example below:<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CardSorting2.png" style="width: 712px; height: 545px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Now, let’s change the context slightly:</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CardSorting3.png" style="width: 939px; height: 474px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The user may group this collection as follows:</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CardSorting4.png" style="width: 939px; height: 504px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The example above highlights how a small change in the context of the content can result in a very different grouping and categorisation of the information. It is therefore essential that the content presented to users is proportionate to the content you need to present in your product and is representative of the correct context for that product. </p> <p> </p> <p>It is always a good idea to perform a tree test (reverse card sort) with users after the initial card sorting exercise in order to ensure that the resultant information architecture makes sense, is usable and understandable.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>From mobile first, to customer first – how to build a mobile app with longevity and appeal</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Entelect_1-3.jpg" style="width: 650px; height: 349px;" /><br /> <br /> <strong>By Doug Crawford (Entelect, General Manager : Service Delivery)</strong> <p> </p> <p>Mobile adoption is changing the way we do business in South Africa.  In 2016, almost 70% of South Africans have browsed the web from a mobile device.  Going beyond content, mobile apps are providing an invaluable mechanism for companies to engage with customers and businesses must carefully consider mobile in their digital strategies.<br />  </p> <p align="center"><strong><em> The global average for app user retention rate is only 3% after a month.</em></strong></p>   <p>Getting customers to try your app is easy.  Keeping them for longer than a week is a different story.  According to Quettra, drop off rates for daily active users are as high as 77% after 3 days, and 80% of apps are only used once before being deleted.  The global average for app user retention rate is only 3% after a month.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What practical considerations should we take into account when building mobile apps and how do we keep customers engaged?</strong><strong> </strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Provide utility</strong><br /> An app offers a channel to an underlying product - a means to an end, rather than the end itself.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1107656326?mt=8" target="_blank">OrderIn</a> provides a delivery service. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/fnb-banking-app/id450094779?mt=8,?" target="_blank">FNB app</a> provides access to banking services. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uber/id368677368?mt=8" target="_blank">Uber</a> offers ride services. Customers rate the product, not the app, and it’s the underlying product that drives app usage.  Without a well-crafted value offering, the app’s shelf-life will be short.</p> <p><br /> The choice of whether to create one monolithic app that serves many purposes, or to unbundle the functionality into several smaller apps can have pros and cons on both sides.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/discovery/id458077762?mt=8&ls=1" target="_blank">Discovery</a>, for example, includes all their products within a single app framework, offering a central point for the customer to experience the brand. For Discovery, this probably makes sense given the integrated nature of their products.  Uber, on the other hand, provides an app for ride sharing and a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uber/id1058959277?mt=8" target="_blank">separate app for food delivery</a>, requiring the user to download both if they’re wanting to order food whilst riding in an Uber from the airport to the hotel. They do however still share a single user account. Ultimately, the app experience should deliver value to the customer in the easiest way possible, having a clear purpose that addresses an immediate need.<br />  </p> <p align="center"><strong><em>Customers rate the product, not the app, and it’s the underlying product that drives app usage.</em></strong><br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Entelect_1-4.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 424px;" /></p> <p><strong>Offer a compelling user experience</strong><br /> <br /> Aesthetics are important, but this needs to extend to a compelling user experience to truly gain acceptance.<br />  </p> <ul type="disc"> <li><strong><em>On-boarding</em></strong> - make the sign up process as frictionless as possible.  Be ruthless when cutting the cruft and be creative in how you balance the need for gathering data versus getting your user productive.  Add value at the earliest opportunity.<br />  </li> <li><strong><em>Navigation</em></strong> - give the user a ‘sense of knowing’ where they are in the app and make sure the core functionality is front and centre.  Optimise the flow and minimise cognitive load required to achieve a task.<br />  </li> <li><strong><em>Performance</em></strong><strong> </strong>- streamline activities on the critical path and minimise back-end dependencies that clog up the experience with twirly animations.  Even better, cache everything locally and sync up asynchronously where feasible.<br />  </li> <li><strong><em>Less is more</em></strong> - unsure whether a feature is important?  If you already have your core functionality sorted, then put it on ice.  Giving users less choice lets them navigate more quickly through the important features without thinking too much about how to get there.<br />  </li> <li><strong><em>Avoid indirect competitors</em></strong> - anything that distracts your users whilst using the app is considered an 'indirect competitor’, which can be detrimental to increasing adoption.  Asking users to enter a confirmation code sent to their email app, for example, detracts from the overall user experience and introduces an indirect competitor into the mix.</li> </ul> <p><br />  </p> <p><strong>Respond to analytics</strong><br />  </p> <p align="center"><strong><em>Quantitative data is key to gaining usage insights, allowing you to respond quickly whilst extending your mobile strategy over the long term. The right data is important: it must be </em>actionable<em>.</em></strong><br />  </p> <p>Measure user engagement through in-app analytics and other channels to determine usage patterns and where user drop-off may be limiting stickiness - such as app crashes, poor performance or a UI choice that may not gel with a broader audience.  Quantitative data is key to gaining usage insights, allowing you to respond quickly whilst extending your mobile strategy over the long term. The right data is important: it must be <em>actionable</em>.  Measuring number of downloads is meaningless from a customer experience perspective since it doesn’t reflect engagement or retention, or drop-off.  Measuring number of crashes, however, is useful and immediately actionable.<br /> <br /> We start our day with an app and we end our day with an app.  Competing for attention in a crowded space means going above and beyond the norm, giving customers a compelling reason to return for more by creating something useful, good to look at and easy to use.  Mobile first is here and a digital strategy without mobile is missing the boat. Providing functionality in a customer’s pocket is not a competitive advantage, it’s a necessity to stay relevant and businesses should be working non-stop to reach and retain customers on their mobile devices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Beware of bolt-on digital transformations - the short-term thinking trap</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:46:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Article-02R.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Beware of bolt-on digital transformations - the short-term thinking trap.</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Digital transformation (DX) is <em>the</em> initiative every corporate talks about and spends vast resources on, it hardly needs to be mentioned at this point. With this level of investment, all these organisations should be well down the path of becoming digital right? A 2017 study done by Forrester Consulting for Microsoft has explored this topic in some depth and highlights that only the minority of enterprises have actually embraced digital transformation as it is envisioned; effectively stating that although there was a strategy (and it got priority), it’s made little to no difference.</p> <p> </p> <p>To begin, let’s attempt to define what digital transformation is. The fundamental principle behind DX is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business. This alone is incomplete without the culture shift this change implies. A business needs to be agile in its approach to evolving, the bloat and inflexibility associated with corporates are widely considered one of the primary reasons DX is not implemented correctly.</p> <p><br /> Forrester Consulting coined the term “Bolt-On” digital transformation, which refers to enterprises that attempt to run digital initiatives as projects without actually realising the need to change the core organisational culture along with the integration of digital technology right across their businesses.</p> <p> </p> <p>In South Africa there is no difference, this is an unfortunate reality across the majority of large organisations. It’s not uncommon at all to see a fully thought out straight-through-process beautifully described, only to find an extremely labour intensive process propping the automated process up behind the scenes. This is a strong indication that digital initiatives are bolted-on as opposed to thinking about DX more strategically and looking for true transformation.</p> <p> </p> <p>Two major culprits behind these bolt-on “transformation” strategies are cost-saving measures and an analogue culture. Leadership in enterprises is well aware of the benefits of digital transformation but have often proceeded without consideration for culture and the drivers mentioned. This results in them consistently battling to keep up with the smaller companies who are taking their market share.</p> <p> </p> <p>Given the focus and investment in digital transformation across South African businesses, one can be optimistic that we’re at least going in the right direction as a collective; we’re tending towards a truly transformed industry. Our large companies are inherently slow to change due to the size, and that’s before taking compliance into account.</p> <p> </p> <p>Still, we must persevere or inevitably fail. So, while bolting-on some digital services, processes or products could offer short-term relief, statistics show clearly that it will stunt future potential. Instead, take the hard road to create and install digital culture in the minds and hearts right across the business. Create a supportive environment where it becomes natural to think this way repeatedly and continuously.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The true value of having a code review culture</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2019 9:25:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Thetruevalueofhavingacodereviewculture-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Code reviews are often seen as a waste of time. This is due to the perception that if you’re not creating code, you’re not being productive. Done right, a code review promotes greater quality software, stronger teamwork, and more inspiration for creativity.</p> <p> </p> <p>The benefits of doing code reviews reach much further than improved code quality. For a well-functioning team of software engineers, reviewing the work of peers and applying constructive criticism is the most focused form of communication. Understanding why a code review process is necessary, knowing how to find reviewers, and responding to reviews correctly, are three core elements of an effective code review culture.</p> <p> </p> <p><br /> <strong>1.    Understanding why a code review process is necessary:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>•   <strong> Code reviews are the most powerful form of sharing knowledge</strong><br /> Sharing knowledge helps development teams in several ways. Reviewers may have a better understanding about the various practices, standards and techniques in the code base that can help improve or consolidate changes. Frequent positive interaction presented in small amounts strengthens social bonds and builds trust between team members.</p> <p> </p> <p>•    <strong>Code is produced at a higher standard</strong><br /> When software engineers know their code will be reviewed by their peers, they are naturally motivated to clean up their code and keep consistency. Sharing work and inviting critical feedback creates a culture of taking healthy pride in work that passes the test first time.</p> <p> </p> <p>•    <strong>The style of code becomes consistent</strong><br /> There are often very different ways to write code and different solutions to the same problem. Consistency in a code base makes code easier to interpret, helps prevent bugs, and facilitates collaboration between software engineers. Most importantly, consistent code can be easily maintained, and code reviews present a natural and easy-to-operate safety net which promotes consistency.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>•    It helps being familiar with the project in its entirety</strong><br /> When a team works on a project, it’s highly unlikely that every member is working on every part of the application. Sometimes one software engineer will work exclusively on a single part of the system, while another is working on something else entirely. Code reviews help software engineers familiarise themselves with code they haven’t written, but might be asked to maintain in the future.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>•    Code reviews make for better estimates</strong><br /> As new features are added to the existing code, having an established code review culture in place increases the accuracy of estimations. Having multiple, informed inputs with context from different areas of the code base, ensures estimates are more reliable.</p> <p> </p> <p><br /> <strong>2.    Finding reviewers</strong><br /> When establishing the guidelines for “who reviews who”, seniority should not be the main consideration. Having juniors review the code of experienced software engineers is a great learning experience for the reviewer. Not only does it give a great reference for design, coding style and architectural decisions, but it also shows how to apply these in the actual project the more junior reviewer is actively working on.</p> <p> </p> <p>Senior software engineers should leverage the fact that new team members lack the context they have built up over the years. This can help push senior members of the team to think about problems differently.</p> <p> </p> <p>Creating great software is a team effort. Whether someone is a junior or senior software engineer, it’s important to make everyone aware that their input is valued.</p> <p> </p> <p><br /> <strong>3.    Responding to reviews</strong><br /> Having an established code review culture in place will ensure that communication lines are open and that everyone can handle criticism. Even so, it takes practice to become a great code reviewer. When capturing feedback on a review or commenting on a pull-request, reviewers should be focused on objectivity.</p> <p> </p> <p>The reviewer’s job is to critically evaluate the work for understandability, suitability, quality and consistency. Where feedback is offered, it should explain any confusion, ask questions, offer recommendations and explore ideas, as opposed to being destructive or hostile. Having this process in place will ensure that reviewees aren’t offended by suggested changes, and that they take suggestions seriously even if they don’t agree.</p> <p> </p> <p>If teams skip or avoid the review process, they are missing out on one of the shortest feedback loops in software development and an excellent growth mechanism for all team members.</p> <p> </p> <p>Creating a code review culture is more than just the process of verifying source code. Promoting interaction and creating an atmosphere that encourages knowledge sharing is what is truly valuable. Code reviews with clear examples and objective feedback, within an atmosphere of trust, is a proven way to build better software, better teams and better engineers.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Stop sabotaging your technology projects: How to communicate requirements effectively</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 14:11:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Stopsabotagingyourtechnologyprojects-33.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Technology teams, departments and industry still hold a reputation for failed projects, where customers and product owners spend too much for too little, or where results pale in comparison to expectations held. We hear about these unmet expectations all the time, followed by budgets blown on project extensions and scope changes. We also hear about customers who “don’t know what they want”, or who “keep changing their minds”. Sound familiar?</p> <p> </p> <p>Many of these projects are unknowingly sabotaged before they start. This is because expectations are mismatched out the starting blocks, and there is little chance that the solution could ever go on to solve the meaningful problems faced in reality. This is a scary situation which traps all parties in projects which are destined to fail. It’s worth spending the time upfront to clarify expectations and give your projects the best possible chance of success.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are four important concepts to help you avoid self-sabotage by communicating your requirements effectively:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1.    Describe the problem, not the solution</strong><br /> You know your business best. Instinctively, you would want to explain how you would solve the problems your business is experiencing. However, this often causes more harm than good. Describing your requirements as solutions will deprive you of the opportunity to explore multiple different solutions with your development team which might have stemmed from a clear problem-statement. We need to recognise that we’re usually not all that great at explaining what we need but are probably quite good at explaining our problems.</p> <p> </p> <p>Focus on the problem space instead. Spend the effort clearly describing the challenges which exist, and what success would look and feel like. Let the experts contribute to the problem-solving process – it’s why they’re there and it’s what they’re good at. When combining good requirements and good problem solving, you allow optimisation for time, scope and quality (and a great overall solution).</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/01.Requirements.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2.    Try not to hide complexity</strong><br /> When compiling requirements, it is important not to mix concepts or priorities in a way which will disorient your audience. Priority should flow from top to bottom, and requirements should be clustered around the problems they’re linked to. What you may consider to be a very complex need may in fact be a simple feature. In contrast, one innocuous line in a requirements brief could ultimately account for a disproportionate amount of the work.</p> <p> </p> <p>Hidden complexity leads to time bombs ticking away in your backlog. Requirements should be logically grouped, and clear enough for your audience to easily spot this hidden complexity so you can clarify it and defuse the bomb before getting started.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/02.Detail.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.    Manage expectations</strong><br /> Expectations must be shared and discussed early and often. Seasoned project managers and experienced software engineers know that expectation management is an important part of any successful software development project. There needs to be a communication culture to ensure that there are shared perspectives of the end result. The tree swing analogy depicts how different parties interpret and implement requirements during the development process. When there is a lack of shared understanding during these processes, stakeholders often genuinely think they are interpreting requirements correctly, but disaster ensues once results are visible and material.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/03.Expectations.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4.    Prioritisation is key</strong><br /> Once there is a clear set of requirements, it is important to rank them. Requirements will vary wildly in complexity, time and cost, which makes a shared understanding of priority fundamental to success.</p> <p> </p> <p>Prioritisation should weigh up what’s important versus what’s urgent, consider the right mix of functionality and differentiation, and take value versus effort into account. Techniques like the MoSCoW method can be used to build this prioritisation puzzle to create a solution that maximises time, cost, customer and business value, and operational objectives.</p> <p> </p> <p>•    Must have: Non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory to complete the project<br /> •    Should have: Important features that aren't vital, but add significant value<br /> •    Could have: Nice-to-have features that would only have a small impact if left out<br /> •    Won't have: Features that aren't a priority for the current scope</p> <p> </p> <p>This allows the development team to arrange the project into phases, plan for minimum viable product (MVP) releases when necessary and have the “nice-to-have” requirements in scope for future phases.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/04.Moscow.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><br /> Requirements are often the primary medium of communication throughout development. Communicating them effectively is clearly not a trivial exercise. Describing needs well means agreeing on expectations between parties from the very different perspectives held by technology, business, product and strategy. It also means that dissonance is managed and dispelled as early as possible in the process.</p> <p> </p> <p>Stop sabotaging your projects. Detail your challenges more so than your preconceived solutions, try not to hide complexity, work to establish shared expectations, and be clear about what is important versus what is urgent. Set yourself up for success.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Sizing up UX: Motivating for UX budget and scoping design time effectively</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/SizingUpUX-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><em>Sizing for user experience (UX) is a complex topic and poses challenges to business development and delivery management teams, as well as UX engineers (UXEs) themselves. We’ll look at some of those challenges, as well as methods to overcome them and scope projects effectively.</em></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>Challenge 01: Organisational UX maturity</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Many of the challenges UXEs face when sizing UX tasks relate directly back to the UX maturity of their organisations. UX maturity is how far along an organisation is in its adoption of UX as a fundamental part of the software delivery process. While good UX is crucial to the success of any digital product, in many organisations work still needs to be done to fully integrate UX into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/01.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>If a company is in the early stages of UX adoption, simply motivating for UX research and design to be part of a project’s scope is a challenge. To organisations with low UX maturity, UX may seem more academic than practical due to its research-intensive nature.</p> <p> </p> <p>While the value of user research and user-centred design has proved itself over time among Fortune 500 companies, it's still seen as redundant by many stakeholders. These stakeholders often feel they know their users better than their users know themselves. This makes actually receiving any budget to consider UX more of a challenge than scoping accurately.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>Challenge 02: Giving definite sizes to iterative processes</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>The second challenge is giving finite timelines to tasks that form part of iterative design processes. Iterative design uses cyclical processes of research, prototyping and testing to optimise and refine design over time. Based on insights gleaned from user testing results, the UXE will often change and adapt their prototypes to either validate or challenge their design decisions. A prototype might go through three or four iterations, or it may take months of rework, ideation and testing to truly answer a user’s needs.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/02.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>The solution: Prove the value of UX without going over budget</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>While challenges will always present themselves, the UXE needs to be strategic in their selection of research and design methods to optimise delivery and stay within budget. It’s a tricky balance that requires negotiation, paired with advocacy and education around UX to convince resistant stakeholders.</p> <p> </p> <p><em><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>The power of open dialogue</strong></span></em></p> <p>It is essential to engage in candid discussions prior to the procurement phase and well before project kick-off. One way to do this is to include product owners and other decision-makers in design thinking workshops. These workshops, such as the now well-known Design Sprint, should be conducted prior to planning and budgeting. This is where design, business and technology representatives will work together to map out the business landscape and define mutual goals for the project, ensuring strategic alignment and understanding. If you don’t engage with your stakeholders, crucial research or testing exercises will be excluded from the project due to a lack of understanding.</p> <p> </p> <p>If successfully advocated for, the UXE can make use of a strategic arsenal of research and design methods to output effective software, and in turn, prove the value of UX. This exercise may need to happen several times before it is institutionalised, but once an organisation sees direct business value, it will become easier to negotiate scope on future projects.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>You’ve got the buy in, now it’s time to size your UX tasks</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Let’s assume you’ve successfully advocated for UX, motivated for budget and developed a solid research strategy. It’s now time to size the various UX tasks you feel you’ll need to complete the project accurately. The importance of sticking to defined timelines is crucial to engender trust with your stakeholders. This is particularly true on fixed-price projects where there is little room for error and so you need to estimate with a high degree of confidence.</p> <p> </p> <p>We can’t account for the sizing of all UX tasks in a single article as that would require a book’s worth of content, but we can look at some key tasks as examples. For the purposes of this article, we’ll look at the sizing of qualitative and quantitative UX research.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><em><strong>Qualitative research scoping example: Contextual inquiries</strong></em></span></p> <p> </p> <p>We'll start with a well-established qualitative research method, the contextual inquiry. This is because it's a semi-structured interview method, making it difficult to estimate for. Contextual inquiries are intentionally less structured, as it allows users to go about their regular activities in their context of use. The UX researcher uses observation, as well as periodic and pointed questions to uncover key insights.</p> <p> </p> <p>When sizing contextual inquiries or other forms of user research, there are two approaches you can use. The first is a dedicated time-box, in which you would conduct as many inquiries as you can within a given timeframe. The second is to decide on how many users you would like to observe and then pre-define how long you would need with each. Let's use the second example, as it is a bit more complex. We’ll work with a single user, then scale it to form part of a full study.</p> <p> </p> <p>The time you require to observe a user is dependent on the complexity of:</p> <p> </p> <p>a.    The system they use<br /> b.    The tasks they need to complete<br /> c.    The access to users themselves</p> <p> </p> <p>Let's use a theoretical example of a task that takes a user 30 minutes to complete. We'll then need to double that time, to account for introducing yourself and the work you’re intending to do, as well as getting consent to observe the user.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/03.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>You now need to repeat this exercise with at least 5 participants to make your research effective.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/04.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>With the added complexity of travel and setup, we can anticipate this task will take a full day.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/05.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Further to that is preparation time: Writing up consent forms, logistics and travel arrangements, as well as any background research that might be required. For this entire preparatory exercise, one might want to bank at least 2 days.</p> <p> </p> <p>Following this is transcribing, collating and analysing the data, which may take as much time as the research itself.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/06.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>We can now see that qualitative research has many dynamics that affect its timing. It’s not much different from investigative journalism or in-store consumer research, so ensure you're accounting for all aspects of your research when scoping.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>Quantitative research scoping: User surveys</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Let’s now look at a passive research method, the user survey. Surveys can take many forms and can use both qualitative and quantitative methods to gain results. The advantage of a survey is the same as its disadvantage, in that the researcher need not be present.</p> <p> </p> <p>During the survey, the most time spent is on setup and analysing the findings afterwards, but the actual survey is relatively quick. If done through an online form, the survey can be conducted without the involvement of the UXE, meaning passive data collection.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/07.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The sizing of a survey is dependent on the number of questions needed to account for the relative complexity of a system or user. If a user or the system they use is particularly nuanced, one might need to develop a variety of questions over a few days. The following explores what goes into creating and sizing a survey:</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>1.    Defining the users you would need to survey to achieve your research aims</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Meet with your product owner or an equivalent subject matter expert (SME) to determine who would be participating in the survey and what questions you will need answered. You will need to define the following:</p> <p> </p> <p>a.    Is there a single user group or many distinct groups requiring separate surveys?<br /> b.    Run a research gap analysis: What don't you know about your users?<br /> c.    What is the complexity of the system you are designing for?</p> <p> </p> <p>The total time spent on your survey preparation can range from a single day to several days. Let’s assume the user base is somewhat homogenous and the system is relatively simple. In this case, you will only need a day or two of preparation.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>2.    Writing your survey and choosing the appropriate technology</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>You now have the necessary background information and stakeholder alignment on your research aims and therefore shouldn’t need to spend more than a day writing your survey. Use online survey tools such as Google Forms, which offers data visualisation and CSV exports to assist in your analysis (it’s also free).</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>3.    Determining how long should you run your survey</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Once you’ve sent an email of your survey out to your chosen participants, you’ll need at least 10% of them to respond. If the survey is internal, you can aim for a 30 –40% response rate.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you hit your response target, you can use the law of diminishing returns to decide whether to continue your survey or begin analysing your results. If sent using a well-marketed email, you’ll generally have a large uptake in the beginning of your survey. After a few weeks, your respondents will plateau before they drop off entirely. You’ll want to close your survey and begin analysing your results before the responses plateau.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/08.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>4.    Analysing your survey data</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Once you’ve gathered all your data, you’ll need to spend a fair bit of time combing through results and trying to find patterns. The time spent will be dependent on how disparate or diverse your results are. If the survey answers are one-sided, then you won’t have to spend much time on analysis. Let's extend our example of a relatively homogenous user base and assume the following:</p> <p> </p> <p>a.    We created a simple survey made up of 10 multiple-choice and yes/no questions<br /> b.    We included 2 or 3 qualitative questions that will need to be read and interpreted<br /> c.    We received 200 out of 2000 responses over a period of one week<br /> d.    We found most answers have a distinct pattern with minor disparities</p> <p> </p> <p>Based on the example above, we can assume our analysis and reporting won’t take more than 2 days. The total active time spent on the survey would therefore be around 4 days, while the total time required would be approximately two weeks.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Estimating design time</strong></span></p> <p><br /> Once research is complete, you will need to apply your findings. This means coming up with prototypes that truly represent and integrate your research. The scoping of prototyping is often defined by the research outcomes and is therefore a bit tricky on fixed-price projects. You often don’t know what you’ll be designing until you do the research.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you’re in a situation where you need to define the scope of design before having conducted research, you will need to analyse work you’ve done on previous projects. For example, you may have designed a similar system in the past or you may have been a user of a system not much different from the one you’re required to design. With this type of knowledge, you can begin to estimate the following:</p> <p> </p> <p>a.    The number of screens that would make up the user-flow<br /> b.    The relative complexity of the system<br /> c.    The features that the user would need to achieve their goals</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Implementation and measuring success</strong></span></p> <p><br /> Once your prototypes have been designed, tested and refined, it’s time to hand over to the development team to implement the design vision. It’s crucial you put measurements in place to track the success of your system, as this will be fundamental in negotiating scope on future projects. Success metrics will also assist in UX adoption more broadly at your organisation. We can therefore add a few more steps to our iterative design thinking model:</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/09.png" style="width: 800px; height: 325px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>It’s certainly a complex task going from advocacy for UX, to the negotiation of budgets and resources, and finally executing your design strategy. Keep the following in mind when unpacking this process:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Align all stakeholders from the start, under a user-centred goal</li> <li>Estimate research and design time as accurately as possible</li> <li>Define measurements of success to prove value of over time</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><strong>In the end it’s all about advocating for the user</strong></span></p> <p> </p> <p>Sizing for UX and negotiating budgets all relates back to the UXE’s central purpose of user advocacy. It’s the UXE’s job to give the user a voice and bring them into business and technology discussions when planning a delivery schedule. This means that the UXE needs to push back if there is a real chance of under-delivery, due to lack of user research and testing. If you fail to provide a good user experience, the cost saved on research methods will be outweighed by lack of user adoption and failed user experiences. As the saying goes, ‘there is never enough time to do it right, but there is always enough time to do it over.’</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Unlocking agile: The power of cross-functional teams</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/UnlockingAgile.png" style="width: 800px; height: 418px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>We’ve finally reached a post-waterfall world, where iterative problem-solving processes have all but eclipsed traditional models. Almost every tech business, IT department and start-up will tell you they are "wall-to-wall" agile, and have embraced Scrum, Kanban or one of the numerous scaled delivery frameworks. Even so, non-delivery is still common because we've not yet learned to consistently build and drive cross-functional teams.</p> <p> </p> <p>A cross-functional (or multi-disciplinary) team is one with every resource they need directly inside the team. Every person shares a common cause and legitimate responsibility. Operating multidisciplinary teams is the next step forward and we already have the tools in place.</p> <p> </p> <p>Industry has a habit of falling back to 'silos' as an operating model, which is often a lazy accountability tool. Splitting teams by skill is meant to aggressively manage capacity, and to ensure people are supervised by managers who understand their expertise. It makes sense, but hasn't translated well into our modern, and competitive, technology economy. In cases like these, each team may be agile internally, but are often powerless in the bigger picture – lost in a sea of dependencies on other teams, skills and departments.<br />  <br /> In today's world, we don't need perfect and complete requirements before design starts, and we don't need perfected design before development starts. Testing can in fact start from the first line of code, and deployments can happen automatically every night. Product updates are days apart, distribution costs are near zero, and the new battlefronts are scale, experience and value. Marketing won't save a bad product, so the tech we ship to customers really needs to stand out.  <br />  <br /> It is becoming obvious that the teams succeeding in this arena are those who collectively realise the benefits of an unrestrained cross-functional team culture. A culture and process that allow skills to blend and overlap, and where responsibility is both fluid and shared. There are no walls to throw work over to, and no 150-page design documents to create a paper trail of safety and a pointless lattice of hard deadlines.<br />  <br /> A cross-functional team means the product owner doesn't have to create requirements on their own. The QA, developers, data team and UX team are all in the same boat, and are just as responsible for the quality of requirements. Every person in the team functionally applies their niche skillset in the creation of the product, but intellectually contributes to the entire process. This doesn't just spread accountability, it creates buy-in, a shared sense of purpose which is an unbeatable force for quality and delivery.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CFTimage.png" style="width: 800px; height: 445px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Mixed teams like this also solve the lazy capacity problem overnight. There is no such thing as a design team with no work because everything is snagged upstream, or a QA team who are waiting for the next UAT cycle. All of these roles are mixed into the cross-functional teams where they carry responsibilities from day one right through to the sunset of the product.</p> <p> </p> <p>Teams in almost every other field work together against a common goal. In football, the strikers are allowed to defend, and the goalkeeper can score. We need to follow this same approach in the technology world because it works the same way. Pull your teams together for a given product and give them a single problem to solve as a unit.</p> <p> </p> <p>Just being physically seated together doesn't count as a cross-functional team. To get this right, our teams need to have mixed expertise with everybody pulling in the same direction, at the same time. This means product owners, designers, developers and testers should be participating in the same brainstorming sessions, and allocated to the same user stories. Everybody should contribute their own specialised talents in parallel, while feeling that their expert views are considered equal in the team.</p> <p> </p> <p>If your teams are feeding work to each other, then you're still operating with one foot in the stage-gated waterfall world. Cross-functional teams will change the game and unlock the real value that agile can offer your organisation.  </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[We’ve finally reached a post-waterfall world, where iterative problem-solving processes have all but eclipsed traditional models. Almost every tech business, IT department and start-up will tell you they are "wall-to-wall" agile, and have embraced Scrum, Kanban or one of the numerous scaled delivery frameworks. Even so, non-delivery is still common because we've not yet learned to consistently build and drive cross-functional teams.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Stop disorienting business with elaborate processes</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 9:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Businessprocesses800.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>As technology specialists, we often find our teams focusing on processes and working models. These processes are the basis of how we solve problems and we often like to share (in detail) how we work. However, even though these elaborate processes are important to achieve the end goal, our stakeholders often have no interest in these models they do not understand.</p> <p> </p> <p>This does not mean that your process or recipe for success is not important. In fact, the right process can make or break a project. The lesson here is to avoid focusing on granular processes and rather focus on the outcomes instead when dealing with customers, or  stakeholders from business or product areas.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>You need to adapt to their language – not the other way around.</strong></p> <p><br /> Your method of working is important to you and your team, but it’s more important to have conversations with your stakeholders in their language. This is especially meaningful at the start of a project. Rather than trying to sell a detailed process of how your team is going about solving each problem, gain their trust by showing that you understand their business and objectives instead. Reciprocating an understanding of context, circumstances and business objectives is a real confidence builder.</p> <p> </p> <p>It’s easier to communicate with business when there is a shared frame of reference in place. This way, clear expectations are created. The below table has some examples on how to translate your method into a valuable message that your stakeholders will understand.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ResultsGRAPH800.png" /></p> <p><br /> <strong>Your process is generic. Rather acknowledge your client’s specific problem.</strong></p> <p><br /> If you consider a method such as design thinking, it can solve practically any problem when applied correctly. Your stakeholders don’t want to know about a process you’ve used multiple times before, because it comes across as a generic solution and not something tailored to their unique problem. Focusing on the process rather than the result is usually a sign of not knowing the client or problem well enough. Your customer knows that it’s much easier to talk about a process that you are familiar and comfortable with. If you have spent enough time and energy to do targeted research and ask questions about the business context and objectives, it becomes easier to focus on the outcome.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Don’t sell your process – let them experience it.</strong></p> <p><br /> Ultimately if you succeed, customers and stakeholders will naturally enquire about the processes you followed to achieve it. Once they start enquiring about it, they will start advocating for it themselves and do the selling on your behalf. Telling your customer how great your process is, is one thing, but having them telling others about your methods is substantially more valuable.</p> <p> </p> <p>Emphasising the value in your process is not always useful, describing business outcomes is. Technology teams should make the effort to adapt to business and gain their confidence by showing interest in results, rather than trying to make a sale in a language they don’t understand.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The priority gap: Why engineering teams have to stop delivering to themselves in early project milestones</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ThePriorityGap.png" /></p> <p><br /> The majority of modern technology teams following a Lean-Agile path are familiar with the “deliver early and often” approach. Even though continuous milestone delivery is a common focus, directing efforts to put something in the client’s hands as early as possible to build trust, is not.<br />  </p> <p>Too often development teams get stuck in delivering to “themselves” and prioritising technology. This alienates the product owner, analysts, sponsor and any non-developers who really need to see progress and problems being solved in a way they can understand – especially in the beginning of the project. Odds are, the business spent months, if not years, trying to sell the project internally before being able to bring on a development team. When the project finally kicks off, it’s only natural that the business feels some excitement and nervousness.<br />  </p> <p><strong>What normally goes wrong</strong><br /> Development teams are technically-inclined, so they will naturally focus on the foundational technology in the beginning. This is important, but doesn’t have intrinsic business value. The time spent on algorithms and the back-end is difficult to showcase to non-technical stakeholders, and will often be seen as invisible work.<br />  </p> <p>Business loses interest if there is too much focus on engineering preferences in early milestones. This will cause stakeholders to feel overwhelmed and isolated from the project. At the other end, if an effort is made to include the business at the start of the project and the focus is on business priorities, stakeholders’ sentiments will increase and trust will grow. The difference between these two scenarios create a priority gap between business and the development team.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PGGraph.png" /><br />  </p> <p><strong>Delivering something that keeps stakeholders engaged</strong><br /> It’s important to gain the business’ trust while relationships are still new by involving everybody in initial phases instead of diving into deep tech work. Technology teams should show that they are keeping the stakeholders’ priorities and concerns top of mind – even if the technologists don’t share those particular concerns. The priority gap causes the business to feel disillusioned and no longer in control of their project, which leads to mistrust early on in the project, before the relationships are there to lean on.<br />  </p> <p>Engineering teams need to be empathetic and reciprocate their concerns of what the business feels the key risks are in the project. It’s important to demonstrate these concerns early on in the project and in a <strong><a href="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=65511">language that the business and stakeholders will understand</a></strong>. This can often be done with visual outputs, or workshops, findings and models which speak directly to those top priorities, instead of new ones which the business doesn't understand or worry about.<br />  </p> <p>The third principle from the Agile manifesto tells us to deliver early and often. However, it’s not always clear <strong><em>what </em></strong>needs to be delivered early and often during the early phases of a project: business value. Business value is often just about reciprocating priorities and sharing empathy with stakeholders. When development teams prove that they’re focused on providing business value, the priority gap closes.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Deconstructing requirements: Why you need to spend more time in the problem space</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 9:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Deconstructingrequirements.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>During development, we often forget how important it is to spend enough time exploring and understanding the full context of a problem before charging ahead with new ideas, “game changers” and designs. Time and budgets are frequently wasted on building (and even perfecting) minimum viable products (MVPs) and tech demos, before the actual problem has been adequately explored and understood.<br />  </p> <p>A central issue that the meaning of the word “requirements” is twofold, and is usually understood as both the customer needs and product requirements. They are written interchangeably without clarifying which one is being addressed or what exactly the differences are.<br />  </p> <p>The suggestion here, is that technology teams must diligently unpack the constraints and customer needs before focusing on the solution. Here are 4 reasons to take this seriously.<br />  </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DIAGRAM-deconstructingrequirements.png" /></p> <p><br /> <strong>Create an even granularity of concerns to address</strong><br /> Breaking the overall vision, history and strategy into smaller, digestible requirements, shapes a solvable puzzle that has less contingencies. Deconstruct the subproblems within the requirements to create a functional map to start from.<br />  </p> <p>It’s also important to remember that the point is not to solve the requirements exhaustively. Explore the problem space fully, but the solution space should have just enough coverage to kick off. The solution will change and evolve as you go, but the problems will mostly stay the same.<br />  </p> <p><strong>The less contingencies you have, the easier it is to create accurate estimates</strong><br /> Less contingencies means more accurate time and resource estimates. If you spend enough time listening to what the business needs, you sometimes realise that you don’t even need a solution or that the results you need are completely different to what you’d expect.<br />  </p> <p>Spending time and exploring business context, history, competitors and strategy takes patience and rigor. Working on the solution is more appealing because it’s new and unchartered. But when too much focus is placed on demos, planning new workflows and designing MVPs; time and budget end up wasted on redundant features.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Technology teams have the ability to detect more complex problems</strong><br /> Your engineering teams are experts in their field, and have the ability to help you find and unpack hindrances that the business might not be aware of. The business team and tech team need to spend time together in this space to discover these complexities early on in the project roadmap.<br />  </p> <p>Use this time to collectively map out the business context, vision and landscape in detail so that both teams are able to answer questions in future, and can become self-sufficient. If everyone fundamentally understands what the business requirements are, they can short-circuit themselves by having the information at hand.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Showing empathy will create customer buy-in</strong><br /> Spending more time truly understanding the business context and constraints of the environment demonstrates empathy. Engineering teams need to show the customer that they care about their vision and objectives, and that they’re putting themselves into the customer’s frame of reference. It’s a relationship-building exercise that gives the customer confidence in their abilities.<br />  </p> <p>As an analogy, consider visits to the doctor. The doctor ideally takes an interest in examining your worries and exploring the causes with you. The added time and patience the doctor takes to listen to your concerns, understand your background, and interpret how you feel, is what instils confidence. When you feel listened to and know that the doctor has all the information needed, you are more inclined to trust the diagnosis. The same is applicable in any complex problem-solving relationship.<br />  </p> <p>As engineering teams, we are naturally more drawn to the interesting and magnetic work in the solution space, and sometimes skip over the problem space without even realising. However, putting extra effort into exploring the business model and success criteria to detect hidden complexities, unpack granular subproblems, create better estimates and show empathy will result in a solution that solves actual problems when it is ready.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>What are we testing: Chasing metrics versus actual software quality</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 9:30:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Whatarewetesting-Banner.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Many engineering teams are focused on redundant input metrics as an indication of the success of “quality assurance” on their technology implementation projects. Are we so busy measuring the number of test cases, pass rates, code coverage and bugs discovered that we have forgotten what real quality means in the eyes of our users?</p> <p> </p> <p>Are we blinded by automation, following widely advertised and theoretical best-practices in the pursuit of quality?</p> <p> </p> <p>We should actually be working backwards from the outcome we want, and applying tools best fit to measure only those outcomes.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Pullquote1.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>In the broader sense, quality means that a solution meets the following requirements:<br /> 1.    The system is robust and reliable<br /> 2.    It does what it says on the box<br /> 3.    It does not frustrate its users</p> <p> </p> <p>Seems obvious, right? But do our measurements actually speak to these requirements or are we simply ticking predefined boxes?</p> <p> </p> <p>The surge of DevOps has allowed us to streamline and automate the entire software development lifecycle. DevOps assumes that just about everything, and certainly testing, can be completely automated. Automation has made processes easier to implement and standardise, but standardisation blinds us from the real objectives. It’s easy, and that’s where the danger lies. We are forgetting to work backwards from results, and to think critically about the quality we’re putting forward. Instead, we are at risk of using analysis tools and automation as a crutch.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Similarly, code coverage has also been idolised as a way to ensure that all code is functional end-to-end. Looking back at how we defined quality above, it is clear that while this gives the development team confidence, it does little for the users. The truth is, we don’t actually need 100% code coverage. Code coverage might be proportional to quality, but it doesn’t guarantee quality. If our code coverage doesn’t speak to the end goal, we may cover all our code and have a perfect system that won’t break, but can still have a system that frustrates our users and doesn’t do what it’s intended to.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Pullquote2.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Why are we not specifically determining what software quality actually means for each unique system, and testing for that?</p> <p> </p> <p>Testing the right things, while balancing time, money and value is what matters. We shouldn’t spend time testing boilerplate code or unit testing other frameworks. There is a degree of assumption that we’re allowed to make and not all failures are equal. Testing high-risk functionalities such as price calculations for insurance premiums is crucial, because the damage it’ll cause to both the system and the business when it breaks is immeasurable. In 2016, a system error from the NHS caused 300 000 heart patients to receive the wrong medication – something that could have been prevented by thorough testing. However, investing time testing low-impact and cosmetic ‘features’ can just be wasteful.</p> <p> </p> <p>Testing in an empathetic frame of mind will allow us to deliver to the users instead of ourselves. The ‘assurance’ component of QA is not intended for the engineering team, because quality is not for our own sake, but for the success of the product and happiness of our users. Many of these metrics do instil confidence which does carry some value, but actual quality should be measured from our users’ experiences with our systems. Sometimes it’s acceptable to have a nervous engineering team and a satisfied user base.</p> <p> </p> <p>We should aspire to confidence for both, an achievable goal if we start with a clear outcomes-defined basis for quality, and structured in a way which can be measured from both perspectives.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Unpacking hypothesis-driven development</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Unpackinghypothesis-drivendevelopment-Banner(1).png" style="width: 100%;" /><br />  </p> <p>If you ever had to take science classes in university or high school, you’d be familiar with the concept of educated guesses. Before an experiment, you were likely asked to come up with an assumption that could be tested – a scientific hypothesis. The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome – and is usually shrouded in uncertainty.<br />  </p> <p>If we see building technology solutions as experiments to learn what customers want and what is good for a business, we can similarly treat any of these programmes as a series of experiments. A sequence of hypotheses, working towards a sequence of goals. The hypothesis is the building block in the scientific method, and should be in agile development too.<br />  </p> <p>In modern agile-inspired approaches, teams need to deliver newer, better, and more robust features to customers in increasingly shorter timeframes. The work being carried out is usually determined by a product owner and often assumed as “proven” before testing it with real users. These features frequently accumulate into mammoth applications where the full breadth of functionality is not utilised, or the application is not user friendly – or more severely – the solution doesn’t truly solve problems for customers.<br /> <br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Hypothesis(1).png" style="width: 100%;" /><br />  </p> <p>To facilitate learning what actually solves problems, hypotheses should be considered and documented for every feature being built to create clarity in purpose. Engineering teams should experiment early and often, receive feedback from customers, and make data-driven decisions based on the findings from every experiment.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Establish hypotheses that can teach you things</strong><br /> Clear and predetermined requirements  are only valuable when several possible solutions have already been tested and validated. However, when you are exploring an initiative with a high-level of uncertainty (which most digital projects are), using atomic hypotheses to guide what features development teams build will ultimately result in building the right thing as you continually adapt away from failed experiments and towards the successful ones.<br />  </p> <p>To form a useful hypothesis, focus on pieces of functionality from a user’s perspective. How will they interact with the solution, and what fundamental problem is it solving for the user? Ensure that these pieces of the solution are small enough to develop within a sprint, and be tested with real-world users directly after that sprint. This will allow you to focus on what works, and parking or discarding the rest. Keep in mind that the larger the feature, the more effort and cost is involved in maintaining, testing, and working around the feature.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Use technology to validate (or invalidate) your hypothesis</strong><br /> Once you have an agreed-upon hypothesis in place, you’ll need to iteratively prove or disprove it throughout the development phases using the tools at your disposal. These validations can be as simple as workshops or focus groups, or may take a little more user research against prototypes to find a conclusive result. In some instances, it’s worth building a proof of concept to pilot in the market (or pilot as a feature within a larger system).<br />  </p> <p>An effective step towards validation is having smaller, cross-functional teams that are able to complete the full cycle themselves, internally. Any requirement to ‘hand off’ work into other teams for research and feedback will put the brakes on the experiment as context is lost and priorities aren’t shared. Cross-functional teams include engineers, designers, and analysts – a multi-skilled team allows searching for, manifesting and learning viable ideas quickly.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Adapt your solution via a series of experiments</strong><br /> Let’s consider an example where a business’ sign-up rate for their eCommerce platform is surprisingly low given the large volume of visitors they receive. To understand the product take-up problem given that marketing seems to be working, they’d need to lay down several hypotheses which can be tested.<br /> <strong>1. </strong>   <strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> Users are getting fatigued by sign-up form capture taking too long and losing interest. Experiment: Cut sign-up requirements to the bare minimum needed to transact, and allowing users to finish their profile at a later stage.<br /> <strong>2. </strong>  <strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong> The product is too expensive, so although there is huge interest in it, a low percentage of consumers are willing to spend the money. Experiment: Offer a slightly cheaper version of the product, with several cut-back features, and measure take-up.<br /> <strong>3.</strong>   <strong>Hypothesis 3:</strong> There is a lack of trust in the product, and visitors are unwilling to sign up (or provide personal details) until they have experienced it. Experiment: Dramatically lower the barrier to entry by allowing guest-transacting and only requiring users to register once they’ve completely taken up the product.<br />  </p> <p>With these experiments in play (albeit pilot versions, with potentially a small customer base) the business can go revisit each hypothesis to establish whether any or all of them were true or false, and then further invest in the solutions which have proven demonstrably more effective at driving product uptake.  This process can repeat as the product evolves.<br />  </p> <p>Testing atomic ideas quickly is advantageous in finding better solutions for businesses , and should be utilised as often as possible. This approach works well with agile-based development due to the short release cycles and ability to adapt quickly.<br />  </p> <p>In hypothesis-driven development, every major feature is an experiment, and every experiment must start with an educated guess. Your goal should be to establish a clear hypothesis for each initiative, and then focus engineering efforts to prove or disprove it. This way, you’ll build products that ultimately succeed in delivering against a clear and measurable user or business goal.<br />  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Is industry becoming irrelevant to digital success?</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Isindustrybecomingirrelevant_Bannercopy4-102.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The majority of present-day digital and innovation projects typically involve digitising products and services to combine or reach across traditional sectors. Enterprises are changing (shortening) traditional customer journeys or creating new digital-only products which have no obvious spot on the value chain. There is a theme here: industry irrelevance. The lines are increasingly blurred, and we’re seeing industries learning from each other, as technology components mature and techniques are normalised in a way that can be applied the same way to banking, agriculture, retail and media.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Consider industry-leading technology companies that have pushed the boundaries on innovation over the last decade. The likes of Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Amazon (and locally, Takealot) are prominent not because they knew their sectors better than their competitors, but rather because their execution of technology and digital customer experience was beyond what was on the market. These platforms are fast, intuitive, easy-to-use and responsive, so they go viral. These are the traits we want in our solutions, and they didn’t come from some hidden industry experience, but rather a marriage of solving real problems and excellence in technology execution.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Industry-PULLQUOTE-19-19.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Execution is more important than industry knowledge</strong><br /><br />Broad expertise in technology execution is the difference between good and great. Teams need to have diversity in experience across varied sectors, and thus the knowledge to tailor problem-solving towards different scenarios. There is more to be gained from lessons in building similar systems in multiple sectors, than by knowing one inside out.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>If you want to be competitive, you have to be the best. This means that you can’t solely rely on industry standards and norms. You have to learn from and build upon what the market is doing in all sectors, all the time.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>If you’re an insurer creating a self-service digital product for customers, you should have an engineering team who is an expert in self-service digital products – not a team who is an expert in insurance. You are the insurance expert that will be guiding the team in industry practices, and business operating context. You want a team that has seen it all, and offer ideas that challenge the industry norms. Not just because it will result in delivery, but because it creates the opportunity for innovation.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>Missing industry knowledge is not why tech projects fail</strong><br /><br />Tech projects rarely fail due to missing industry knowledge or experience, but rather due to missing technology experience, awareness, practices and pragmatism in execution. These are things which are universal to projects in any industry. Having a technology team with some experience in the industry will certainly help – but it won't make or break project.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The reality is that most failures are borne from issues in delivery that have little to do with industry expertise. Weak or non-existent technical leadership, planning, fundamental skills, tools, practices are the culprits here. A veteran team with lessons in delivery of complex solutions in multiple scenarios can navigate any project. They can learn each context rapidly, and surmount the real killers of delivery: expectation management, collaboration, productivity and technical know-how.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>The narrow expertise bias</strong><br /><br />Teams who have been deeply embedded in a single industry often develop “blinkers”, hiding possible solutions which are obscured by repetitive industry system norms.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Our brains are naturally wired to find patterns in seas of information. When engineering teams are biased because of their narrow experience within a single business or industry, they risk boxing themselves in, hiding alternative ideas for how problems can be solved with technology. With diversified experience, teams can challenge your thinking and bring new, innovative ideas from different industries, teams and platforms.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Teams with a broader view of technology, domain, and business processes have a hunger to learn and to solve problems. Broad technology practice trumps narrow industry expertise, clinging to industry standards will prevent you from differentiating your business, and remaining competitive.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Platform-oriented IT is universal</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Platformstrategy_Bannercopy4-106.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>As options for creating and building digital platforms are expanding and becoming more complex, most enterprises seemingly want to either build or become one. A <em>business platform strategy </em>is an approach to entering a market, offering products and services to it and at the same time offering that channel to competitors looking to reach the same market. This method allows you to practically own the customer, and when done right forces other participants to sell through you to reach customers. This enables you to become the mall, not the tenant – or both. Think Uber, Airbnb and Amazon.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>“Becoming the platform” is an ambition for many businesses, but even if you can’t or won’t become one of these industry-owning platforms as an enterprise, you still need to start planning and implementing an <em>internal technology platform</em> strategy. Platform-oriented IT is universal, and leading technology enterprises are leaning on this approach to grow or transform into technology-enabled and technology centric businesses.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Tech giants logically group their IT efforts into platforms, with each platform catering for a specific product, service or channel towards users. These platforms are managed independently and create a framework for re-use that accelerates product development and results in more coherent channels. If your data, systems and processes are organised this way, you’ll launch products faster, offer a more consistent customer experience across every channel, and can harness economies of scale in non-functional areas like security and performance.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Organisations of practically any size will benefit from a strategy like this, which is why it is becoming so popular:</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>1. Be faster to market</strong><br /><br />Platform-oriented IT allows business units to focus on what they are good at. It seems like an obvious approach to reuse the tools that are already available, but the truth is, most business units in the enterprise are still treated as silos to avoid dependencies and politics. They just build what they need from scratch, top to bottom. Creating new IT foundations for every initiative might be liberating, but it is also wasteful and slow.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>There are some among us who have learned how to pick the granularity that makes sense and offer minimal friction in a dependency tree. The idea so to create and offer shared data, services, DevOps and infrastructure that the teams actually want to use and are readily available. This saves development time, releasing it for valuable product validation, testing and iteration time on core features.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>2. Offer a more consistent customer experience</strong><br /><br />Customers expect the same treatment when dealing with different offerings under your brand. They aren’t interested in the fact that different services have different processes, and generally expect a level of consistency when interacting with multiple departments.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>This is a question of execution in digital customer experience. It is hard enough to create beautiful, intuitive and memorable user journeys once, why exaggerate that problem by forcing every new team and project to do it alone, and again? Re-using channels which are designed to accommodate a variety of ‘tenants’ does require more planning, and technical skill upfront, but is clearly a better long-term approach to consistency for your customers.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><strong>3. Make non-functionals a shared investment</strong><br /><br />While it is very difficult to justify costly security, performance, or infrastructure upgrades for a single product, pooling these investments make enormous financial sense. In a platform-oriented IT structure, each business unit receives the benefit of communal investments into non-functional characterises of their shared platform. All for a small premium required to support the shared team, tooling and technology required.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>When platforms are segmented correctly, privacy, security and scalability changes can be implemented across all departments that need to use it – without the concern that a certain unit does not have current capacity to do them.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Internalplatform-23.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Internal platforms are the secret weapon behind rapidly growing tech companies, and also one of the keys to leverage limited technology talent in an enterprise. It’s a no-brainer to share core IT, API and customer journey capabilities across the organisation. For the computer scientists, platform-orientation for businesses is like object orientation for software architectures.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>We need to take the <em>bad flexibility</em> away (total control top to bottom) in order to promote the good kind: customer-centricity, shared services faster time to market. Start moving towards platform-oriented IT, centralising your internal IT thinking, and easily drive compliance and security consistency.</p><br /><br /><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Proudly South African? Not technically…</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[However, many seemingly ‘proudly South African’ businesses are choosing to outsource their technology and software solution requirements to countries such as India, China and the United States, directly damaging the local industry.<br /> <br /> ‘Investment in local skills and technology is crucial, and much of our country’s future growth is expected to stem from these fields,’ says Shashi Hansjee, CEO of Entelect, one of South Africa’s most successful software solutions companies, ‘In that case, it is important to explore the reasons why businesses are not advancing their resources to our own local workforce.’<br /> According to Hansjee, South Africa boasts some of the world’s most <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=45183" target="_blank">cutting-edge, impressive and broadly experienced information and communication technology (ICT) professionals</a>. Hansjee says, ‘Cities such as Cape Town and Johannesburg, where many of South Africa’s most prominent businesses are based, have already proven to be hubs for technological innovation, yet businesses are still sending their opportunities outside of our borders.’<br /> <br /> Some key differentiators that South Africa’s ICT skills base offers in comparison with service providers abroad, include the fact that using local talent naturally facilitates stronger communication between project stakeholders. ‘This ultimately increases the overall success rate and shortens the delivery timeframes,’ says Hansjee, ‘We have also seen a number of case studies that showcase how South African ICT providers’ strong communication principles and agile methodologies positively differentiate us from overseas competitors. In fact, many South African developed software projects have translated into successful and viable products and businesses.’<br /> <br /> Hansjee suggests that in the past, companies seeking ICT services elsewhere may have been put off by problems such as trying to locate and train local talent to the point where they are able to become part of a mobilised workforce, and so the seemingly safer and more familiar option of outsourcing took preference. ‘Many feel that education standards may not be up to international standards, particularly as a result of South Africa’s low global rankings in the maths and science fields,’ he explains, ‘However, remarkable improvements and developments have taken place around access to ICT education in recent years, and we do not believe that is the case today. We are privileged at Entelect to be exposed to some of the world’s finest tech experts on a daily basis.’<br /> <br /> Hansjee does, however, concede that some disparities do occur in our local education, but rather than take their business elsewhere, South African organisations should see this as an opportunity to invest in and improve on our educational systems. ‘It is crucial that businesses recognise how vastly different and exponentially improved today’s local technology expertise is, compared with just a few years ago, and see the potential that lies within our own population,’ says Hansjee, ‘If big corporates and organisations take the pioneering steps of showing confidence in our local talents, their example will open up a veritable floodgate of opportunity and growth, attracting more local – and even international – business opportunities.’<br /> <br /> The CEO concludes, ‘With thousands of jobs expecting to be opening up in the ICT sectors for South African businesses, a key goal for the country as a whole should be to foster a culture of addressing local business needs using local expertise.’]]></content:encoded>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[These two challenges are coupled with the fact that companies are rapidly exploding from 10 employees to more than 200  in relatively short timeframes. With all this in mind, the human capital of a company is its most vital component and it determines overall business success or failure.<br /> <br /> Career development and performance management in a small company is easy, often senior management is operationally involved and the roles and responsibilities are generally unstructured or loose. Most people in early startups accept that they do whatever needs to be done on the path to success, even if that means fixing the printer when they are developers by trade! <br /> <br /> As the company grows, senior management starts becoming less and less operationally involved – and this is when things start becoming tricky. It is at this point that processes and policies need to be created. These are both critical to the overall growth of the company. At Entelect, our core value has always been focussed around our employees and we have made numerous efforts to ensure we succeed in managing their performance and, most importantly, that our employees are continuously growing. As with any process, it’s about learning and these are just some of the lessons that we’ve learnt along the way: <ul id="careersList"> <li>Ensure that key performance indicators and career paths are well defined, easily accessible and part of the company culture.</li> <li>Take the time to continually evolve your performance appraisal process. We have done this numerous times over the last ten years and it has made a massive positive impact</li> <li>Do not rely solely on the feedback captured during the performance appraisal process but rather over time, document and consolidate as much information around an employee, including the number of hours worked, client commendations received and training attended. All of this information will give you a more accurate reflection of the employee’s performance when required</li> <li>As senior management, you should not be afraid to let go of the performance appraisal function, especially if you get to the point where you cannot give each employee the adequate amount of attention he or she deserves. Make sure the person who has this responsibility is armed with the necessary tools and information</li> <li>Grow a strong base of staff leadership that have capacity to give each employee the time he or she deserves</li> </ul> <br /> As your company grows, you will continue to face many challenges: embrace them, continue to adapt and remain relevant to your staff’s needs.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>High Performance Teams</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The coders worked in teams of six to ten people and looking at the success of the end products, the competition raised the question: What constitutes a ‘high performance software development team’?<br /> <br /> <strong>1. The right individuals</strong><br /> <br /> The level of ability (or potential ability) and experience of members is crucial, and an individual’s selection will depend on the nature of the project. Attitude, however, trumps ability every time. In coding, there are two types of individual: those who find problems and those who find solutions. Choose members who have a bias for finding solutions – they will bring energy to a team that is normally drained by problem finders. A positive mindset and can-do attitude go a long way.<br /> <br /> A team leader will emerge naturally, especially where there are varying degrees of experience in the team. Whether explicitly identifying an individual as team lead or letting natural selection play its course, leaders who display the characteristics of servant-leaders (those who look to enable the full potential of those in their team, rather than taking an autocratic, command-and-control style) are better suited to leading high-performance teams.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. The right combination</strong><br /> <br /> Collaboration is king in high-performance teams but finding the right combination of individuals is significantly more challenging. Team dynamics come into play and the myriad of behavioural habits and thinking preferences, and combination thereof, can be difficult to assess up front.<br /> <br /> Identify the combination of individuals that will communicate effectively. Assemble a cross-functional team that has all the skills necessary to get the job done, eliminating external dependencies wherever possible. Once collaboration and skill sets are addressed, shift the focus to providing the right environment (location, tooling and so on) and trust the team to do the job.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Setting the stage</strong><br /> <br /> Having a well-defined purpose is a strong motivator. Individuals who understand the big picture and who buy into the objectives of what the project is trying to achieve, will naturally aim to maximise the value of their contribution.<br /> <br /> Success often comes only after a number of failures. If you are looking for innovation from your team, tolerate failure. Create a ‘safe’ environment in which the team can experiment with ideas, new technologies and approaches. Encourage the team to explore uncharted territory and stretch the boundaries of what is possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Involvement </strong><br /> <br /> As the project sponsor, product owner or any other direct stakeholder having a vested interest in the success of the project, become involved. Show an interest in the successes and failures of the team and be a champion for the project and team across other business units. High-performance teams are proud of their work and recognition for their efforts will directly impact their level of motivation.<br /> <br /> A high-performance team is a crucial element in delivering a successful product and once you know what constitutes a winning team, it could be the start of something game-changing.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>What makes a great software engineer?</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following observations and institutional learnings are based on years of working in and with software teams of different sizes, across a number of industries, technologies and architectural complexities. They are in no particular order because in reality, priorities for each of these will shift based on context. What is important though, is that these are all positive traits, and engineers who display these, would almost certainly be productive and most likely to accelerate through their career.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Attitude over aptitude:</strong> A great attitude can take decades of personal development but becoming technically competent takes a fraction of that time. A competent team will have the resources to rapidly teach, mentor and develop a junior engineer who doesn’t necessarily start out with the sharpest technical skills. A negative attitude will invariably prevent or hinder learning. Building competencies for people with tertiary-level education is usually far less onerous than changing their attitude.</p> <p> </p> <p>An ability to relate on a personal level to colleagues and clients is crucial, so to be a great engineer, you need to be the engineer whom everyone wants to work with. Being a technical guru is insufficient if nobody wants to work with you. Great software engineers avoid condescension, narcissism and an inflated ego. In communications, this means they are able to listen attentively, be assertive and concise. Great engineers also able to present themselves without aggression. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Awareness and analytical nature: </strong>Some engineers struggle with ‘tunnel vision’ into the solution space, where they focus too much on the solution without properly evaluating the problem. Great software engineers are astute, able to place requirements in context and maintain awareness of the problem-space while working through the solution. </p> <p> </p> <p>This awareness should pervade all aspects of their work, especially the ability to be aware of what already exists in a given solution, and how it can be reused to solve requirements more efficiently or in ways that weren’t directly suggested. One of the hallmarks of great software engineers is a shrewd talent for solving problems on their feet in meetings, workshops and pair-programming scenarios.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Maturity in approach:</strong> Great software engineers apply their mind to all aspects of the engineering process in a considered and non-selfish way. Here are a few examples of what this means in practice:</p> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>Seeking constructive criticism – great engineers ask what they could be missing in a design, how would it not work and whether it is understandable to the users and the rest of the team</li> <li>Asking for the background of a requirement to see how it fits into things and seeing the ‘big picture’ – great engineers look to stabilise requirements before rushing ahead with development. For example, similar work items should be checked to see if there is an overlap, offering an opportunity to combine or reuse</li> <li>Taking initiative – when working on a specific requirement, great engineers will explore ways to improve the solution beyond the exact provided requirement</li> <li>Communicating regularly – status reports, stand-up meetings and involvement in the broader software and client context are all easy ways to be noticed though excellent service.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Career-path intuition:</strong> A career in software engineering is vibrant and varied so it is difficult to have a template for growth that can be applied to junior engineers in a blanket fashion. Being senior is less about how many years you have worked and more about your maturity, competence and value you can provide to a team. The best software engineers see this for what it is – an opportunity. Furthering a career in the field is about understanding the context and demonstrating an insight into what makes a software engineer a ‘senior’ or a ‘lead’ within that organisation. Armed with that knowledge, great software engineers can tailor their skills and initiative to push themselves further.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ultimately, what separates great engineers from good engineers is a natural maturity in approach, personality and attitude that goes beyond the expected competence in the technical aspects of the software craft. This might seem counterintuitive given the implied technical depth in the job and to be fair, in many positions, an expert level technical competency is an absolute minimum. However, the point is that often, technical strength will only get you through the door, where these ‘softer’ aspects then take over.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Matthew Butler (Entelect Software: General Manager: Managed Solutions) <br/><br/> When compared to disciplines such as mechanical, civil and industrial engineering, software engineering as a craft is still young, despite its rapid growth over the last two decades. Much of this growth has been driven by Twitter, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, all of which have generated substantial interest in the field. As a result of this surge in interest, software engineering has become an attractive career option and it draws in people with a wide variety of talent, personality, knowledge and attitude. Given these variations, it is worthwhile looking at the traits that make a great software engineer.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Employee loyalty programmes: a Band-Aid® for a gaping wound</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2015 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South African companies are not only competing within a national context for top-tier software talent but they are also up against international organisations on their own soil. These organisations have cut their teeth in far more competitive markets and have decades of experience in managing software environments on the South African companies. It is not breaking news either that there is a very limited pool of skills to draw on, and to top it off, in South Africa, there is a through-the-roof demand on enterprise developers in all sectors. This dangerous combination and a heavily imbalanced supply-and-demand picture has forced software-service companies and corporates to take a closer look at their retention rates and invest in programmes designed to improve these figures, or suffer churn as the talent is pulled towards the highest bidder.</p> <p>The problem with this approach is that companies are designing loyalty programmes to mitigate that fact and as a result, they avoid the tough questions that examine the organisational causes of staff churn. When used in this way, loyalty programmes are the equivalent of sweeping the problem under the carpet. They cannot solve fundamental, underlying issues that require investment and political will to transform, much in the same way that a Band-Aid cannot stop arterial bleeding. Giving employees a free smoothie is not going to keep them working for you, let alone engaged with their work if they have a poor relationship with their team, have very little input, control or ownership of their work, or work in the basement of a dilapidated building with poor ventilation.</p> <p>The power of a loyalty programme lies in its ability to enhance what is already a working organisational culture, and to incentivise positive behaviour. Loyalty programmes are incredibly useful tools for this purpose and the benefits of this approach have been well studied and documented, some of which you can read about on the <a href="http://www.encentivize.co.za." target="_blank">Encentivize</a> website. </p> <p>So how then do we, as the businesses who depend on these individuals, move ourselves into the future with a predictable strategy for retaining and attracting top software talent? The answer is not easy, nor is it the same for everyone in the game. However, at Entelect, we know that it begins with self-reflection. For a retention programme to be effective, it cannot simply be a rewards system. At worst, it needs to be a comprehensive overhaul of the organisational culture, processes and management practices of a company. We have identified some common success factors within teams that have high retention rates and although not universal, there is generally a shift towards empowerment, autonomy, transparency and inclusivity in all the teams.</p> <p>Knowing where to start can be tricky. In our business of software services, customers and staff are two sides of the same equation and success is an exercise in identifying our value proposition for our staff, and working just as hard to balance that equation as we do for our customers. Embarking on this journey has taught us that retention in the world of software development means taking a long hard look in the mirror at who you are as a company and committing to improving yourself, for your staff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why candidate liability clauses are bad for business</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>This time of year is critical for recruitment. Many companies are actively searching universities all over the country to secure the best candidates to join their graduate programmes. Similarly, many graduates are entering the job market for the first time and are navigating their way around the recruitment space, looking for the right recruitment agent to help them identify the best career opportunity.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, in recent years there has been an increasing trend by recruiters to ask candidates to sign what has been called a Candidate Liability Clause. Given that a large number of graduate candidates are new to the recruitment industry, many assume that all components of these agreements are standard practice.</p> <p> </p> <p>The most contentious component of these agreements is that if a candidate reneges on an offer after written acceptance, the recruitment agency claims damages against the candidate. Usually, the agency demands from the candidate an amount equal to the commission or fee they would have earned upon successful placement.</p> <p> </p> <p>While this practice is not common, it has been in existence for some years. In 2012, the Federation of African Professional Staffing Organisations (APSO) amended its Code of Ethical and Professional Practice, banning the use of the Candidate Liability Clause. As such, it required all members of APSO to adhere to this ban and provided a candidate notification that informed candidates that an agency’s only right would be to seek damages in line with their legal rights.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, the frequency of this Candidate Liability Clause practice suggests that there is still a lack of clarity around this issue and what is permitted.</p> <p> </p> <p>Carmen Williams, General Manager: Talent Acquisition at Entelect, says, “At this time of year, graduates are planning for their first job. Many of them will be stepping into the recruitment space for the first time.”</p> <p> </p> <p>She believes it is critical that candidates understand how the recruitment industry works so that they are not misled by unethical practices.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Successful placements can only exist when a candidate wants to join a company, not because the candidate feels intimidated into joining by the prospect of incurring damages fees if they don’t.”</p> <p> </p> <p>APSO has also joined the discussion in an attempt to provide clarity on the issue. While APSO recognises that some members may wish to seek damages in certain instances, it expressly prohibits recruitment agencies using a Candidate Liability Clause as a means of recovering these damages. Part of the problem, explains Roly Boardman, chairman of the APSO Ethics Committee, is that there is currently no requirement for recruitment agencies to be members of an industry body such as APSO.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Membership of APSO would serve to monitor unethical practices and give candidates recourse when a dispute occurs,” he says.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, why is this practice bad for business?</p> <p> </p> <p>Firstly, contracting a candidate to cover damages should they decide to change their mind on an offer is not conducive to a successful placement. A candidate who feels bound to a job offer through fear of incurring damages fees is likely to enter that position in a negative state of mind and feel cheated out of their preferred choice. Jobs that start like this do not last and replacing these employees incurs more expense in the longer term.</p> <p> </p> <p>Secondly, a large number of companies are not aware that potential candidates are asked to sign this document. Consequently, it can be a poor reflection on the companies these agencies represent, not to mention that this practice may be in stark contrast with the values of the organisations they serve.</p> <p> </p> <p>Thirdly, this practice can result in a poorly matched placement. On the one hand, a company may lose out on an excellent candidate because he or she is unable to change their mind. On the other, a company may take on an employee who would have preferred to join another company.</p> <p> </p> <p>Williams has a good view of both sides of the industry and believes that this issue points to the role of the recruiter.</p> <p> </p> <p>“The role of the recruitment agent is to help both the candidate and the company make the best decision,” she explains. “If the recruiter is prepared to nurture this part of the process, damages fees should not be an issue.”</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>What should company’s and candidates look for?</p> <p> </p> <p>1. When it comes to identifying the right candidate for the right role, the onus is on the recruiter to perform greater due diligence throughout the recruitment process. Boardman supports this view by asking the question, “Surely we cannot employ people without personal interaction?” He firmly believes that we need to bring personality back into the recruitment process, saying, “We simply cannot afford to miss out on good candidates because the right information was not discovered.”</p> <p> </p> <p>2. Part of a recruiter’s process is to counsel candidates on what to do in case of a counter offer, helping them understand the pros and cons of accepting a counter offer. It is in the interest of all parties involved that the candidate takes the best career opportunity available to realise a successful recruitment process.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Candidates and companies should ask a potential recruitment agent whether they are a member of APSO. This way they know a code of ethics is being followed, and should there be any cause for recourse or dispute, all parties involved have the support of an independent party.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>When engaging a recruitment agency’s service, companies and candidates should find out what the terms of engagement are. If an agency does indeed apply a damages fee, then companies need to consider how this may affect them.</p> <p> </p> <p>“A candidate must be free of coercion of any sort to make the right decision for them,” concludes Williams. “It is important that companies start to determine the kind of practices they want from the recruitment industry, and start demanding it, or only work with those recruiters who share your organisation's values."</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Using the power of communities to stay relevant</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As software engineers, we need to stay on top of a continuously evolving industry - the stronger and more diverse our community network of engineers and developers, the greater chance we have to remain relevant.</p> <p> </p> <p>Communities are popping up in all areas of our lives because people no longer just do one job or hobby, they have a number of passion projects and interests. Increased connectivity and social media have enabled this. Finding a good community is like finding your perfect match; when it's good, the most amazing innovations can emerge from your collaborations with like-minded people.</p> <p> </p> <p>We often think of communities as formally established groups but communities can also be much smaller groups of people that share similar ideologies.  Often these people choose to define their connection in a way that reflects their social identity and practice. The most rewarding thing about communities can be the knowledge sharing and the personal networks that develop from them.</p> <p> </p> <p>At first, it may seem obvious as to why it can be valuable to interact with the larger development community; to share knowledge. But, there are other advantages that are not always obvious until you are part of a development community.</p> <p> </p> <p>1.    Sharing passions, ideas, and goals, can accelerate your personal growth exponentially. But the first, most important, trick to getting the most out of a community is not to look at it for what you can get out of it, but rather look at what you can offer. Networking is a two-way street and the second you can show yourself to be someone who is always willing to help and share knowledge, the quicker you will be able to build your network. </p> <p> </p> <p>2.    The software industry moves at an incredible pace. While developers may be exposed to many of these trends in their day jobs, there is always more to learn. For instance, have you considered ember.js as a tool when you hit the limits of your current Single Page Application framework and do you know what pitfalls to look out for? Or, do you know what options exist for bringing your next application into the augmented reality or virtual reality world of the future?</p> <p> </p> <p>3.    In the same vein, because of the continuous evolution of the industry, troubleshooting is as much a learning curve as learning new languages and technologies. Communities provide software engineers with an experimental space to learn and also troubleshoot with like-minded people. The advantages of having a space to troubleshoot don't just apply to work in community forums, but also problems you may come up against in your day-to-day working environments.  You’ll find you are able to work through problems more quickly, which will ultimately add value to both your career and the projects that your employer is undertaking. Not to mention the insights you will bring to your community will increase exponentially.</p> <p> </p> <p>4.    One of the less obvious but most compelling advantages of being part of a community is that it can give guidance to your career. Being in touch with the latest changes in the industry will help you to make strategic decisions about your future career; where you want to be three years from now, what skills you need to get there, and most importantly, how to stay relevant. Fostering relationships in a community will have a positive effect on your career; who knows who you may meet?</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>We’re lucky in South Africa; we have access to a number of international communities such as GitHub and stackoverflow, but also some locally emerging communities such as source.technology. But the User Groups are possibly the most active. Groups including DevUG, Jozi-JUG, and Android UG are all very active and have a high number of developers who attend events.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are also a number of conferences in South Africa which are being created by the community such as DevConf and JSinSA. Attendance at these kind of events is sky-rocketing.</p> <p> </p> <p>Within companies, Slack is also becoming hugely popular, and channels such as such as ZA Developers and ZA Tech enable smaller communities to emerge and interact all the time. After all, a community isn’t an official group with a name, it’s a collection of like-minded people, so sub-communities can exist anywhere.</p> <p> </p> <p>We, as developers and leaders in the industry, need to take ownership to drive these initiatives and lead by example. We have so much knowledge to share and so many upcoming developers who are hungry to share in our knowledge. There is a shortfall in good developers in South Africa but no shortage of jobs for great developers. Let’s build and participate in communities to help bridge this gap and grow to our full potential – as individuals, and as an industry. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>BI developers should be treated like gold</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Have you considered who has the most insight into your business? The CEO, CIO, or perhaps the CFO? After all, these are the people making the biggest decisions about the business. They are presented with all the necessary information to make strategic business decisions. Right? Not necessarily. </em></p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Actually, the people with the greatest insight are a little bit lower down the food chain. They are the Business Intelligence (BI) developer. The reality is that we may not have considered the BI developer because for many years, these people have been left in situations where they are always playing catch up with organisational changes. It was almost a reverse-fit; the organisation uses existing data insights to make a financial decision on how to improve efficiencies, then the BI developer goes in to engineer the support system around that.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">It’s been an interesting journey for BI developers. When SQL was launched in 2005, the only conceivable approach, given the richness of each the feature tools in the BI stack, was a collection of specialists. Then came the next generation of BI developers; the generalists. Those guys who knew enough to be able to support, maintain, and occasionally, enhance the solution implemented by the specialists.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">But things have changed, significantly. BI developers (previously the ‘generalists’), have now acquired something that no one else in the business has; a unique and holistic view of the business systems and the business processes. In fact, at a mid- management level (and because of the nature of their role), these developers have a unique perspective and access to data at virtually all levels of the organisation and across all functional areas.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">I often refer to them as the 'Miss congeniality' of organisations. They have typically been in the organisation for a long time, had contact with almost all departments and are well liked by everyone. The result is that as a BI Developer, they have the capacity to inform and influence strategic business decisions.  They are becoming the ‘Intelligence Engineers’ of organisations. Spending less time on technical work and far more on data discovery, predicting trends, understanding influencers and advising businesses on solutions to problems they never knew they had.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">BI developers should be treated like gold and nurtured. They have so much intelligence at their fingertips. Losing this when a BI developer looks for greener pastures, or more challenging opportunities, could significantly damage your market position. Maybe not next month, but certainly before the next BI developer has got his or her feet under the table.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">Consider retention strategies, make sure they are specific to the resource needs and growth opportunities. BI developers should have business critical skills, domain knowledge across industries and business silos. Even ownership in the business.</p> <p style="text-align:justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align:justify;">The reality is that if these guys leave, they leave with an exceptional amount of knowledge about your business. So don’t let them become the Intelligence Engineer of another organisation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The company breakaway – old-fashioned relic or indispensable business tool?</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The company breakaway is often dismissed as a day or two out of the office for a bit of fun and a few hours of discussion about the business. More often than not, the phenomenal ideas that seemed so innovative around the table never materialise. Lessons learnt are quickly forgotten and the passionate commitment to “doing things differently” and “going the extra mile” soon gets swallowed up in the daily grind.</p> <p> </p> <p>But according to Doug Crawford, manager: service delivery at Entelect, the breakaway is still highly relevant in today’s business environment. In fact, he believes it’s more relevant than ever.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect is a software development company that runs teams of on-site developers across a range of clients and projects throughout South Africa. Each project is operationally independent, which means there’s no need for the project teams to interact or engage with each other. However, from a strategic and developmental perspective, there is a lot they can learn from each other.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Each year we take a day out of the office to bring together our project team leaders from across the country – we call them ‘team leads’ – to share experiences and discuss creative and innovative ways to address common challenges in the business,” says Crawford. “More importantly, the sessions give team leads and management the opportunity to interact in a dedicated and focused setting that allows for a healthy two-way communication that isn’t easily achieved by other means.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Sounds like any other breakaway, right? But Crawford says these interventions have yielded several success stories over the years.</p> <p> </p> <p>“The breakaways are heavily solutions-focused,” he explains. “Before the event we circulate a list of topics or tasks that will be unpacked during the course of the day. Team leads are required to make notes for discussion on each of the scenarios. On the day itself we divide the group into teams. Each team is allocated one of the topics to unpack and debate in the morning session. Teams then present their solutions to the group in the afternoon.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Some of the challenges from the last Entelect breakaway were:</p> <p> </p> <p>• Create a toolbox to help our new or young team leads run effective career, growth and performance discussions with their team members.</p> <p>• Create an on-boarding pack that can be used by team leads and other team members to ensure new members joining a team have the best possible experience and are able to deliver value to the client and team at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>• How do we maximise visibility across the company of the technical achievements and innovations being delivered by our teams?</p> <p>• How can I inspire a sense of purpose in my team that creates a common-ground for our client, staff and company interests?</p> <p>• How do we ensure teams and clients are aware of and making use of Entelect’s value-adding services?</p> <p> </p> <p>“The depth of discussion was impressive,” says Crawford. “As a management team we are already working on operationalising a number of the ideas that came out of the most recent session.”</p> <p>Some of these are:</p> <p>An on-boarding toolbox to ensure a comprehensive and consistent on-boarding experience for new team members</p> <p>A discretionary “happiness” budget for each team to spend on anything that will make them happy</p> <p>Team CVs that list capabilities and achievements at team level leading to awareness and boosting profile within the company</p> <p>Generating thinking around value-add activities, e.g. knowledge sharing, training, events and workshops</p> <p> </p> <p>The sessions also play a very important role when it comes to internal mentorship.</p> <p> </p> <p>“We currently have 44 team leads in the business,” explains Crawford. “Breakaways provide the ideal forum for the whole team to network and form relationships. Some people in the team are very experienced, while others are new to the role or to the business. During the breakaways we actively encourage connections between newer and more experienced team members, which serve as informal mentorship-type relationships.”</p> <p> </p> <p>It’s not only management that sees value in these sessions. Team leads themselves gave some really positive feedback after the most recent breakaway.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I really enjoyed the day as a whole,” says Jonathan Counihan, who works on one of Entelect’s teams based at Sage. “I like the fact that our input is valued and some actionable items come out of it. I think the networking aspect is also very good, as it gives the leads a chance to touch base and build support structures.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I really feel part of the team the way the Entelect management keeps us in the loop about the company strategy and vision.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Schalk Wolhuter, who leads the Entelect team at Discovery Vitality RSA, says, “Put a group of highly motivated and bright individuals in a room, shake them a bit and out comes ideas and solutions. This is what happens at an Entelect Team Lead breakaway.</p> <p> </p> <p>“A properly thought-out scenario list, a room full of team leads, a great venue… and the only thing that can happen is that problems will be solved.”</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why we fail to find the right job</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a 2013 Gallup study, 70% of the American workforce are not engaged at work. Around the world, across 142 countries, the proportion of employees who feel engaged at work is just 13 percent. LinkedIn estimates that 66% of its 350 million users are actively or passively seeking a job. </p> <p>So why is it that so many people are unhappy in their jobs? For me the answer is simple- people make career decisions based on the wrong reasons.</p> <p>During my past 8 years in recruitment I have interviewed hundreds of people, most of which couldn’t tell me why they were really looking for a new job, what they were looking for in their next job or, what type of culture or environment would best suit them.</p> <p>People should be asking why do they want to leave. In data analytics a ‘why’ analysis goes a long way. The process is to keep asking ‘why’ until you get to the very core of why you want to leave so that you can understand what will make you feel fulfilled.</p> <p>Often we take the first offer, or move just for more money. In fact money is far too often associated with success – we think if we’re earning more money then it’s a measure of how successful we are. But a salary is not going to determine how much you will be challenged in your job or whether you will feel fulfilled by the day-to-day work.</p> <p>In the book “In Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,” Daniel Pink, says that knowledge workers are motivated by three things: autonomy, mastery and purpose.</p> <p> </p> <p>Autonomy: when we are in control of what we do, how we do it, and when we do it. That should always be the case in a true Agile working environment.</p> <p>Mastery: when we are constantly learning and evolving, becoming better professionals and better human beings.</p> <p>Purpose: when we feel that our job is important and we are contributing to make things better, instead of just doing what we are told without understanding why.           </p> <p> </p> <p>Therefore, we see that people work for recognition, not money. Understandably, money does feature in the decision making process. However, we need to be more strategic about our choice and view money as one element rather than the most important element.</p> <p> </p> <p>In my experience, people never leave a job because they dislike their salary, they become unhappy because they are not feeling fulfilled in other areas of their role and then the salary compounds the issue. Growth (mastery), a sense of independence (autonomy) and fulfilment that your job makes a significant impact on the lives of others somehow (purpose) are the defining factors.</p> <p>In the technology industry, these issues are compounded by the fact that the industry is fast-paced and growing exponentially. There are many new jobs emerging all the time, so this can make it harder to make your decision.</p> <p>So next time you go for an interview, why not change the questions you prepare for the interviewer to be focused on autonomy, mastery and purpose and appreciate the interesting conversation that unfolds. The money will follow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Performance appraisals: Helping you reach your full potential</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>Performance appraisals have a bad rap. They are the meetings that many of us dread. But, the truth is, performance reviews present some great opportunities if you know how to get the most out of them. </p> <p> </p> <p>Appraisals are there to identify your potential and help you realise your goals. Entelect want to give our staff both the challenges and tools you need to be successful. Appraisals are simply a great platform to discuss this so that you can become the best at what you do.</p> <p> </p> <p>The first thing to remember is that there are three main purposes of appraisals which are always constructive: Alignment, growth, and the opportunity to have crucial conversations. The reality is that everyone comes from different career backgrounds with different experiences. While we all join a company with great capabilities, our experiences are different, and so aligning ourselves to the company and teams as well as ensuring we’re continuously growing is critical.</p> <p> </p> <p>In order to get the most out of your appraisal, it is important to understand the expectations of the session. We often approach performance reviews as something that happens to us. But it’s a two-way street and our role in the appraisal discussion is crucial to shaping it fully. Specifically, this is your opportunity to let your manager or team lead know what your goals and aspirations are.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, take the time to prepare carefully. If you review yourself critically, consider the values or principles that are important to you, and if you can articulate this clearly, you will find the session far more constructive.</p> <p> </p> <p>The structure of reviews at Entelect mean they are quarterly. There are two ‘major’ sessions; in May and November, and then two ‘minor’ sessions in March and August.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ‘major’ reviews are structured to be ‘360’, which means they survey your colleagues and clients throughout your day-to-day role in order to obtain a full view of your professional development. This is done via an online tool and then discussed in person with your Account Manager or Team Lead. Listening is crucial in this session, as your team lead will have taken the time to synthesise your ‘360’ feedback and draw themes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Always remember that when someone offers you feedback – positive or negative - it demonstrates an interest and investment in your growth. Whether your feedback is positive or negative, learn to respect all feedback and understand it as someone showing an interest in your growth and you will start getting more out of the sessions.</p> <p> </p> <p>This person’s objective is to help you progress and meet your full potential. We all have blind spots: areas of development that hadn’t occurred to us. If these arise then listening closely is extremely valuable and will help us to work out ways to apply the learnings and development areas.</p> <p> </p> <p>Of equal importance is for the reviewee to share his or her personal experiences. Our personal interpretations of our workplace are shaped by our own experiences. It is essential that we are open and honest about these too, to help inform how life at Entelect looks from the perspective of every employee.</p> <p> </p> <p>Indeed, some of the best performance advice we can receive is from our peers. They work with us every day; see our strengths and weaknesses, wins and frustrations. Therefore, it is important to dedicate enough time to reviewing your peers and providing them with the kind of constructive feedback you would want to receive. Raising issues is not something to shy away from, as long as they are substantiated and show opportunity for growth.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelectuals strive to be challenged, receive recognition for work well done, and aspire to the best they can be. Appraisals will help you reach your full potential. So, don’t dread reviews. Be prepared, take control of the session, and apply the learnings to help accelerate your career and be the best you can be.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Tips on ways you can prepare for your review:</p> <p>• Set aside at least an hour to complete your online form.</p> <p>• Don’t rush it. Find a quiet place where you can think clearly.</p> <p>• Be honest, open and thorough.</p> <p>• Remember that ratings mean nothing without comments.</p> <p>• Take the time to read your team members feedback, and identify the points that stick out.</p> <p>• Prepare a set of notes for your discussion to ensure you cover everything that is important to you and to help guide the conversation.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How software engineering candidates can create an impact in a highly competitive market</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Demand for software engineering skills continues to rise. According to a report issued by The Joburg Centre for Software Engineering (<a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/media/wits-university/news-and-events/images/documents/JCSE%20Skills%20Survey.pdf">JCSE Skills Survey</a>), a University of Witwatersrand partnership with government and industry, there is ‘an immediate unsatisfied need for skills in the ICT sector…’</p> <p> </p> <p>At the end of 2015, a paper from Empirica (<a href="http://www.empirica.com/home.html">empirica</a>) indicated that, ‘the European market could absorb 756 000 ICT practitioners by 2020 if sufficient supply was available’. And in June 2016, Cisco announced that it will invest $10 million over two years in a scholarship programme to increase the pool of talent (<a href="http://investor.cisco.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/news/news-details/2016/Cisco-Launches-10-Million-Global-Cybersecurity-Scholarship-to-Increase-Talent-Pool-Introduces-New-and-Updated-Certifications/default.aspx">investor.cisco</a>). Locally, the May 2016 edition of the Career Junction Index showed that Software Development remained the most sought-after skillset on the Career Junction website and just 25% of those jobs available in December 2016 were filled (<a href="http://investor.cisco.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/news/news-details/2016/Cisco-Launches-10-Million-Global-Cybersecurity-Scholarship-to-Increase-Talent-Pool-Introduces-New-and-Updated-Certifications/default.aspx">CJI Executive Summary</a>).</p> <p> </p> <p>The reality is that, large software engineering companies are competing for skills and resources to deliver against the business opportunities, which are being driven by traditional industries such as financial services, insurance and healthcare sectors. But the competition is tough.</p> <p> </p> <p>Companies competing in the IT space are continuously looking for ways to set themselves apart from their competitors, which is resulting in increased demand for high-quality software engineering candidates.</p> <p> </p> <p>This year, Entelect took on 40 of the top Computer Science and Engineering candidates in the country, up from 30 in 2016. On an average month, Entelect employ anywhere between 5-10 full-time employees, which is testament to the number of opportunities out there at the moment.</p> <p> </p> <p>But unlike many other industries, the South African Software industry should be considered as having a supply issue, rather than a demand issue. That means the industry simply cannot fill the jobs available with the necessary skills. Computer Science and Engineering is still listed by the Department of Higher Education and training as a scarce skill (<a href="http://www.dhet.gov.za/Gazette/Government%20Gazette%20No%2039604,%2019%20January%202016.%20List%20of%20Occupations%20in%20High%20Demand%202015.pdf">DHET scarce skills</a>) and although graduates are increasing, it is not at the pace the industry needs.</p> <p> </p> <p>In our view, the most sought-after skills in the industry at the moment include Java, C# and Angular, and typically, candidates with these skills are in high-demand. However, it would be wrong to assume that because there is a supply challenge, this means it is easy to get a job in software engineering. The reality is that continuous increases in security, big data and consumer lifestyles makes this industry the backbone of many other, more established industries.</p> <p> </p> <p>Hence, this supply issue places a challenge on the companies because service standards must remain high.</p> <p> </p> <p>Software engineers need to demonstrate technical accuracy and extremely high levels of craftsmanship in every aspect of their job. The industry moves too quickly to absorb mistakes and technical errors so candidates must demonstrate exceptional skills.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, technical accuracy alone is not enough. Candidates are also required to demonstrate other, softer skills, which will positively impact their ability to deliver effective solutions in teams, but these are often overlooked by candidates when selling themselves in an interview.</p> <p> </p> <p>Craftsmanship: The drive to transform what is currently a skill into an art of exceptional ability.</p> <p> </p> <p>EQ: Self-awareness and having a deep understanding of oneself is an important skill when managing teams and clients effectively. </p> <p> </p> <p>Articulate: The ability to express ideas clearly and with a high-energy drive efficiencies and productivity in the workplace, especially when working on tough projects with tight deadlines.</p> <p> </p> <p>Team spirit: People who have a strong team spirit tend to be collaborative, which is critical for identifying the best solution for the project or problem.</p> <p> </p> <p>Confidence and passion: These traits drive behaviours such as the desire to learn new skills, techniques or technologies quickly, to go above and beyond your daily tasks and to bring creative flair to their role.</p> <p> </p> <p>Once a candidate can demonstrate that they have the exceptional skills to create an impact, the opportunities available as an employee in this industry are extensive. Apart from exposure to cutting-edge innovation, there are many other less obvious benefits that candidates will be exposed to which are, arguably, unique to this industry.</p> <p> </p> <p>Firstly, in a new industry there are many opportunities to create new solutions and address new problems. This means that the occasion to practice autonomy is far greater than in well-established industries where there are pre-defined best practices and rules of engagement. Autonomy is a significant growth accelerator.</p> <p> </p> <p>Secondly, there is the opportunity to become a master in your field. The competitive nature of the software industry means that companies are looking for true crafts men and women. Being exceptional is the flavour of the day.</p> <p> </p> <p>Thirdly, purpose. Employees today are looking for purpose in their jobs. Software engineering is often considered the backbone of many industries and as such, every problem software engineering solves will ultimately better or improve the lives of others somehow.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Given this, when recruiters talk about ‘opportunities’ in software engineering, they are not just talking about the number of jobs available in the market, although this is very true. They are talking about the opportunities for growth, personal development and purpose which are presented by a relatively new industry that is at the forefront of innovation.</p> <p> </p> <p>Undoubtedly, the future of the software industry is on an exciting trajectory. The pace of innovation means that competition will remain extremely high. Candidates that can reap the rewards of this industry are those who can offer exceptional craftsmanship and understand the value of the softer skills in the delivery of the most agile and effective services and solutions a client can employ.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is important to consider what additional skills you can offer a software company that will help set them apart from their competitors. Understand the marketplace, and your position in it. There are many good software developers, but exceptional ones are far fewer between. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The journey to becoming a Data Scientist.</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The role of the data scientist is one of the broadest roles in the software engineering field at the moment with the expectations on these individuals being extremely high. However, there is growing controversy around the roles and responsibilities of a Data Scientist and at what point can you fairly call yourself a Data Scientist.</p> <p> </p> <p>To begin, we need to be cognisant that the industry itself, especially in South Africa, is in its infancy. So industry standards which outline the breadth of knowledge required on Big Data and Analytics technologies have yet to be defined. Although, fundamentally, the role of the Data Scientist is closely linked to being Big Data developers and implementers of solutions that encompass large amounts of structured and unstructured data. </p> <p> </p> <p>However, when hiring Data Scientists, we need to understand that there are only a handful of people with experience across the board. Organisations are mostly hiring people with pockets of knowledge or, graduates or juniors with the right passion. In reality, Data Scientists have many years of experience and a breadth and depth of knowledge that is relatively unique.</p> <p> </p> <p>At Entelect, we believe the journey to Data Scientist begins as either a Big Data Engineer or a Big Data Analyst, and there is an important distinction between the two roles.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Engineers are traditionally from a Software Engineering background. They have spent some time in the trenches learning Linux, networking and the Hadoop ecosystem. I’m not limiting the Engineer role to the Apache technologies, most vendors are releasing amazing solutions that would classify them into the Big Data field; however, they are leveraging the initial architecture and concepts of Hadoop.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Analysts typically come from a Maths and Statistics background. They have been tinkering with databases, ETL’s and ELT’s as well as basic data mining models. These guys understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, what a random forest is, and a vast array of other analytics techniques.</p> <p> </p> <p>Both these roles set extremely strong foundations on the path to becoming a Data Scientist thanks to their problem-solving skills, both technical and logical.  At this point, these individuals are now set to start moving up the ranks in terms of Data Science. However, there are still a number of learning imperatives required before becoming a Data Scientist.</p> <p> </p> <p>At Entelect, we have established a training path to take these individuals towards the end goal of being a Data Scientist.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Moving to junior or intermediate level</strong></p> <p>There are several decisions the engineers and analysts need to make. Initially, a lot of them are related to breadth versus depth of knowledge. I have always believed you should develop a vast breadth of knowledge across all relevant technology stacks and then focus on achieving depth of knowledge in relevant areas over time. If you are really committed, this means you end up with both breadth and depth of knowledge.</p> <p> </p> <p>To tackle this, the data solutions side of Entelect created a roadmap designed to take a Big Data Engineer or Analyst through a structured programme to provide the breadth across the engineer and analyst role.</p> <p>This is similar to the Entelect Graduate Bootcamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFNj6fzOIAc), where graduates or juniors are provided with an overview of the main stream technologies, which helps them develop a breadth of skill and from there, the Graduates can move into specific areas of software.</p> <p> </p> <p>For the data solutions training programme, we leverage a few of the MOOC’s, a host of our internal training material but most importantly we use something known as a Structured Incubators approach.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Structured Incubators provide real-world scenarios filled with mini challenges designed to expose everyone to all aspects of the Big Data environment. It covers everything from installing and configuring Linux clusters, all the way through to running their first data mining model. Several technologies are used, however the concepts learnt during these incubators are the key to success.</p> <p> </p> <p>The most important key to a successful incubator is constant mentoring. At Entelect we have attracted several Big Data Engineers and Analysts and provide constant support to aspiring Data Scientists. Constant feedback loops are given to the participants though various mediums, frequent show and tell sessions are conducted, and several ad hoc challenges are given to the participants, ranging from taking 2 days out to enter a Kaggle competition all the way through to producing some real-world analytics on relevant subjects (http://source.technology/political-party-analysis).</p> <p> </p> <p>Regardless of experience in the field, the initial training programme must be followed by all our engineers. If a person has experience in setting up clusters they are still required to complete the entire incubation period to ensure that everyone is on the same minimum level.</p> <p> </p> <p>We have seen great success with this, constantly pushing the guys out of their comfort zone, throwing them in the deep end and making sure we provide the support for them to float.</p> <p> </p> <p>This initial period takes roughly 10 weeks to achieve a broad overview. At this stage the individual is still operating at a Big Data engineer or analyst level.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Moving to intermediate level</strong></p> <p>This field changes far too quickly for anyone to stand still and rest on their laurels for 6 months so growth isn’t optional. We strive to help our engineers and analysts experience a variety of industry verticals and technologies to support their growth.</p> <p> </p> <p>At this point, data engineers and analysts start finding their passion and gaining a depth of knowledge in a certain area. This is not a career direction, but more a career enhancement. The learning paths change slightly and more focus is given to the relevant area of interest. However, growth in the other areas never stop. If someone enjoy doing the data analysis we would focus the training roadmap more on R/Machine Learning/Python aspects. However, there will still be investment in furthering the knowledge on the engineering side and vice versa.</p> <p> </p> <p>The roadmap for career growth is a long one. We estimate roughly two years of part-time focus to achieve solid, well-rounded knowledge to become a Junior Data Scientist. This would encompass understanding SQL, NoSQL HQL, Linux, Windows, Spark and another 90 technologies relevant to data science. All of this needs to be coupled with real world experience across various industry domains to develop the entire picture of implementations, use cases and critical success factors of big data projects.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>So now you are a junior data scientist, what’s next?</strong></p> <p>At this point you should be able to take a blank slate, setup a big data environment, ingest data, execute useful analytics and provide a presentation layer to any organisation you are at.</p> <p>The next step is to continue deepening your knowledge, the focus is then put on advanced statistics, graph theory, advanced data structures, streaming analytics and finally we move into the Probabilistic Modelling and Deep Learning.</p> <p> </p> <p>Once you have proven competency, a solid track record and a vast breadth and depth of knowledge, at this point you are considered a Data Scientist.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>As the industry becomes more established, we expect to see this path to Data Scientist becoming more commonplace. At Entelect, we use the roadmap to ensure our Data Scientists are true craftsmen in their field and can consistently provide the highest quality service and solutions to their clients at all times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Loyalty: A morphing concept in the age of a fluid workforce</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years, loyalty in the business environment was measured by tenure or resignations. However, this is the age of the fluid workforce. That which motivates Millennials to stay or leave a company is driven by many things, several which are largely out of the hands of HR managers. Unless they reframe their understanding of loyalty.  Says Yatish Parshotam, Chief People Officer, Entelect.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The baby boomer generation tended to stay in one job for their entire working career. My dad is a great example of this having been a shipping manager for a company for 25 years. His previous job was for 15 years. In neither job, did he receive fancy perks or bonuses, there were no ‘pause’ areas or coffee machines.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, fast forward to the Millennials workforce and we’re seeing a dramatic shift in the mind-sets of our employees. The pace of employee needs and demands in the workplace has changed. Along with their expectations of management. For some while, the phrase ‘people leave their managers not the company’ may have been true, but it does not sufficiently address the reason for leaving.</p> <p> </p> <p>According to a recent industry surveys,</p> <p>• 29% of millennials are engaged at work, 16% are actively disengaged, 55% are not engaged (gallup)</p> <p>• 21% of millennials say they've changed jobs within the past year, more than 3x the number of non-millennials (gallup)</p> <p>• 44% of Millennials say, if given the choice, they expect to leave their current employers in the next two years (deloitte)</p> <p> </p> <p>Many companies today have adopted new policies and practices to provide an environment that supports and encourages Millennials. There are great work opportunities, succession planning, well-defined growth paths, autonomy, health programmes, training and mentorship. But employees still leave. Why?</p> <p> </p> <p>Does this mean that employees today are not loyal or, should we be redefining our definition of loyalty? Our reality is that we live in an age of a Fluid workforce so can loyalty still exist and if so, what drives loyalty in this environment? In my opinion, employee engagement is one of the key factors.</p> <p> </p> <p>Typically, people leave because there is a deeper cultural misalignment with the company. Companies need to recognize that loyalty is a two-way street. That means not only providing employees with growth and development opportunities but also taking the time to engage with them personally and understand their aspirations. This is most authentic when the support offered is entirely selfless. Sometimes, that means encouraging people to follow their passions even if that means they move out of your organization.</p> <p> </p> <p>The reality is people will leave. That is the nature of today’s fluid workforce. However, loyalty is something that begins within the organisation, but it could reach far beyond the four walls of your business.</p> <p> </p> <p>When people leave our company, they do so for many reasons, some of which are personal and, which no counter-offer can address. But if that person knew there was an authentic, selfless interest in their personal development and growth, then they will remain loyal to your company beyond their duration with you. Because employees who move on, do so with the value you’ve contributed to them.</p> <p> </p> <p>For the past three years, Entelect have participated in the Deloitte Best Company Survey. This past year, our results reflected some of this thinking, specifically around building loyalty with employees in a way that reaches beyond the four walls of this business:</p> <p> </p> <p>• 93% of respondents felt that in the last year they’d had the opportunity to grow and learn</p> <p>• 94% of employees believed that this company cares about developing people for long-term careers, not just the current job</p> <p>• 95% said they could identify with the values of the organization, and</p> <p>• 94% said there is a feeling of trust throughout the organisation</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>In real terms, practices that achieve results like these means your employees will likely continue to be your brand ambassador beyond their time with you. And that they will do so out of a genuine appreciation for the value you have contributed to their growth. They may wish to return to your company, provide high quality referrals or, you may find that strategic business partnerships emerge that could have far reaching benefits for the future.</p> <p> </p> <p>In my role, working for a software engineering company, my greatest excitement comes from not only helping people grow in their roles but as people in their personal lives as well. When they move on, their relationship with our organization remains strong because of the value we have contributed to them professionally, and personally.</p> <p> </p> <p>Companies must demonstrate loyalty to their employees by treating and investing in them as though they will be with you forever. You will never be able to control the market; competitor hiring strategies, economic downturns, or consumer trends. But if you focus on the individuals, your company will be far stronger.</p> <p> </p> <p>Engage with your employees on a personal level and selflessly put their growth first. This is where loyalty starts. But there is no reason loyalty should end here. Employees valued in this way will remain loyal to your organization for a very long time and the relationship could grow into something more than either of you expected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Yatish Parshotam (Entelect, Chief People Officer) <br><br> In today's work environment, the concept of loyalty is changing. So how should we redefine our concept of loyalty and what are the benefits of this thinking?]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>The importance of socialization at work</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the purpose of socialization? For many years, socialization in the workplace was a way to help employees ‘let their hair down’ after a long week. Friday night bar or braai was a way to give back to employees. But company culture is going through a transition. Employees now expect more connectedness with their company.</p> <p> </p> <p>According to Professor Matthew Lieberman, human interaction is a basic human need, which he equates to our need for food and shelter. “Being socially connected is our brains lifelong passion” says Prof Lieberman. As such, socialization has several purposes and outcomes which should not be dismissed when we shift into a business environment.</p> <p> </p> <p>The simple truth is that fostering friendships at work helps employee engagement. It creates a positive environment where employees feel connected and can develop a sense of purpose with their peers.</p> <p> </p> <p>Often, socialization takes place within obvious groups such as project teams. But it should also be encouraged across traditional business boundaries to help stimulate a sense of connectedness with the company.</p> <p> </p> <p>Boundaries can be created around teams, hierarchical groups, personal interest groups or career goals. Sometimes they are obvious, sometimes far less apparent. But socialization is something that can traverse any boundary; a junior to a senior on another team, two people striving for promotions in different sectors, or weekend interests.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, developing communities isn’t easy. It requires a company to provide platforms and environments that support and promote relationship building. This isn’t just Friday night bar, although those kind of events does serve a purpose. The initiatives must be part of a bigger strategic, thought-through, program to promote relationship building across various ‘boundaries’.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>What should be the true intent of Socialization?</p> <p> </p> <p>The true intent of socialization is two-fold; to create camaraderie which serves to drive accountability and delivery in the work place, but also employee engagement which leads to job satisfaction and a sense of personal fulfillment.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, these goals can fall apart if the company in question does not appreciate that relationships are not merely a means to an end, but an end in itself; one that must be authentic.</p> <p> </p> <p>Camaraderie is a key feature of a successful team because it creates a sense of mutual accountability and responsibility. Employees who have a sense of accountability, responsibility, and self-fulfillment are more likely to stay engaged in the workplace. Hence it can logically be considered to have a positive effect on retention, as these features relate to personal development. </p> <p>So, what should your company do to promote community and socialization?</p> <p> </p> <p>Without knowing it, socialization starts on your first day; introductions, onboarding. Already there is a connection made in those first few hours and days as people get to know each other.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then there are the connections made as people join project teams and begin to integrate themselves into roles and take on responsibilities. However, very often, this is where socialization begins to fade. The pressures of the project deadlines mean that work becomes the focus and socialization quickly moves to second place.</p> <p> </p> <p>One should realize that socialization is an ongoing practice that never ends. Once you’ve settled into your team, there are opportunities to socialize with new employees, or form a relationship with your client, which leads to more opportunities to socialize and engage with clients from different departments.</p> <p> </p> <p>Although after work drinks can be a great social tool in its simplest form, relationship building at work serves the greater purpose of providing personal and professional support.</p> <p> </p> <p>Companies must spend considerable thinking time dedicated to establishing various and multiple social opportunities. In some instances, this may feature as part of an appraisal or a less formal growth objective, where the employee makes a considerable effort to attend the social activities or even manage arrange the social activities.</p> <p> </p> <p>Non-traditional examples of socialization initiatives include community events such as User Groups and Entelect’s DevDay. Social investment initiatives, such as the Entelect Foundation, or sports events are more typical activities that companies such as Entelect use to help break down traditional boundaries in the work place and encourage their staff to create relationships across teams, projects or hierarchies.</p> <p> </p> <p>At Entelect the Social Clubs are run by employees, where they have full ownership and autonomy of their clubs.</p> <p> </p> <p>Take the mountain climbing club for example. They meet once a month whereby the venue will either be indoor or outdoor and the tools required for climbing are sponsored by Entelect. A typical day would include 10-20 people including the spouse or plus 1. Then you have a good 3-4 hours of community building, cross-team teamwork and support for their fellow climbers. The day after the event, pictures are shared on the internal social platform and plenty of jokes and chatter around the day and events as they transpired.       </p> <p> </p> <p>Socialization however, is also very personal. Some people prefer to socialize in large groups where there is lots of energy such as the climbing club. Whereas other people prefer to socialize in small groups or one-on-one. Companies need to find ways to support and facilitate these different connecting styles, otherwise company culture will become exclusive rather than inclusive, which is ultimately the goal.</p> <p> </p> <p>A good example of a way to engage with people who prefer smaller groups is to invite a fellow employee from a different team on a coffee run. Or to join the Chess Club at Entelect, where they meet bi-monthly. These interactions present less social pressure and can often result in making a stronger connection as it’s one-on-one.</p> <p> </p> <p>Given the importance of socialization, many companies should make sure that it is a key part of their culture. Whenever someone asks me, why do I drive the social culture in a company as much as much as I do, my response always comes down to the following; One-third or more of your day are spent at the office. You can just as well build relationships and community, as it is so much more fulfilling in your working environment when you collaborate and feel that you belong.</p> <p> </p> <p>Employees expectation of companies is most certainly shifting, and companies need to view an employees desire to belong as positive. While this places a few extra demands on a company to ensure they are providing relationship development opportunities for every type of personality, they must remember that creating camaraderie in the workplace and improving employee engagement will lead to job satisfaction and a sense of personal fulfillment for everyone in the workplace.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why you should be uncomfortable as a manager</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I built an oscilloscope the other day. I’m not sure what I’m going to do with it but the point is that I built it and, in doing so, I learnt a few things, including how to present information meaningfully on a small device, which is becoming more relevant in the field of software development.</p> <p>For a few hours, I was out of my comfort zone but I was learning, researching and understanding new concepts. The fact that I had an oscilloscope to show for it was a bonus but what really mattered was the journey of creating something, of problem-solving, and that incomparable sense of achievement when it was finally finished. Even if it was 3am and I knew the kids would be looking for breakfast in a few hours.</p> <p>This process of learning and creating got me thinking about leadership in the fast-moving technology space. In the new age, our comfort zone is the danger zone, and if we don’t occasionally step out of the boundaries of what we know, it’s impossible to stay relevant and to keep our finger on the pulse of this dynamic industry.</p> <p>Get comfortable with being uncomfortable</p> <p>Too often, managers get bogged down by administrative tasks, performance reviews and growing the business. While this is important because it keeps our heads above the trees, we also risk losing touch with the industry because we can’t see the wood for those trees.</p> <p>Learning is one of the driving cultural principles at Entelect. It’s how we increase our value to our peers, colleagues and clients. It’s how we find new and novel approaches to problems and services. But most importantly, it’s how we stay relevant in our field.</p> <p>Learning forces you to think outside of the boundaries of what you deal with on a daily basis, exposing you to new technologies and industries, and giving you an opportunity to apply your knowledge and systems to other problems.</p> <p>Colour outside the lines</p> <p>Managers often reach a level where engagement with junior staff, potential and existing clients, and the industry as a whole is not possible because their focus is on business development.</p> <p>But what if I told you that the business development we strive for is just on the outside of our comfort zone? It’s on the ground, among the coders who are deploying systems and meeting deadlines; it’s on social media, connecting with people who share your passion for home automation and can help you figure out why your swimming pool light won’t turn off automatically. It’s in the audience at a Bitcoin conference, even though you work for an environmental NGO.</p> <p>By spending time on site, managers not only get a chance to see what coders are working on and to get a better appreciation of the challenges they face, but they also have an opportunity to connect, to share ideas and knowledge, and to identify opportunities to do things differently or to elevate a task to become a standard. By pulling ideas from the learner, the hobbyist and the person in the delivery stream, managers will instinctively know how and where to grow the business.</p> <p>The new comfort zone for managers is not behind a desk, it’s on the ground, fetching coffee and pizza while the team works towards deadlines. It’s among the coders and tinkerers at user groups and dev days. It’s attending industry conferences on topics we know little about. It’s engaging on social media, forming relationships with like-minded people and building trust.</p> <p>Technology changes rapidly. Getting comfortable with the way things are and by only operating within the boundaries of our business is dangerous territory and puts us on a fast-track to irrelevancy. But by engaging, learning, sharing, having an opinion and finding a creative outlet, we earn the trust and respect of our colleagues and clients, and there’s no substitute for that in the professional services industry. You might end up with a pile of useless oscilloscopes, but I promise the journey of getting there will be worth it.</p> <p>Now, excuse me while I figure out how to automate my swimming pool light before the kids wake up for breakfast.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How software communities can create jobs and stimulate the economy</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The South African economy is at a tipping point. Slow economic growth and the recent downgrading of the sovereign rating has dire consequences for job creation and business growth. In times like these, businesses start looking at where they can cut costs and jobs are usually the first on the chopping block.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the software industry is well-positioned to buck this trend, to create jobs through learning opportunities and to spearhead innovation that can help businesses cut costs and improve efficiencies in other areas.</p> <p> </p> <p>Digital transformation has become a massive focus in recent years. Spend in the e-business sector continues to rise, with BMI TechKnowledge putting spend on IT services at R63 billion in 2016, up from R56.9 billion in 2015.</p> <p> </p> <p>Reasons for this shift include increased access to the internet; the Internet of Things changing how people are interacting with business; access to data; and the ability to analyse and respond to data intelligence.</p> <p> </p> <p>According to WEF, South Africa is classified as an efficiency economy; however, the growth of industries in the knowledge economy keeps South Africa competing with top-performing international markets such as Australia, Europe and the US.</p> <p> </p> <p>Demand vs supply</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately, unemployment in South Africa is at one of the worst levels ever recorded. Youth unemployment is particularly drastic and worsening. According to Stats SA, 30.1% of youth aged 15 to 24 are not in employment, education or training, which is a percentage point increase on the previous year.</p> <p> </p> <p>South Africa desperately needs job opportunities for young and recently matriculated students so that they can enter the job market and stimulate our economy.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, job creation requires two things. Firstly, jobs, but secondly, the technical skills to meet functional job requirements. Without both, job creation remains a theoretical discussion.</p> <p> </p> <p>For the software industry to be properly supported, we need the required skills in the market. The South African economy will benefit the most if the required work is completed locally without the need to outsource these skills from international markets. Ideally, the resulting skills should come from a well-balanced diversification that is representative of our country’s demographics.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately, we’re just not there yet. According to a recent Career Junction report, demand does not meet supply. That is to say, more than 30% of jobs in demand come from the IT sector but less than 7% of job placements have fed the IT sector, indicating that job growth in the tech sector is misaligned to the skills and talent coming through the education system.</p> <p> </p> <p>Although there are some excellent graduates coming through the South African varsity system, there is a vast amount of untapped talent that does not reside in the formal education system.</p> <p> </p> <p>Those on the periphery of the software talent pool may be there for several reasons: their parents do not understand the industry well enough to be able to recommend it as a career choice for their children; disadvantaged youths may not have access to computers to kindle that desire; or it may also be that girls are simply not encouraged to enter a male-dominated field.</p> <p> </p> <p>The power of communities</p> <p> </p> <p>Informal knowledge environments such as tech and software communities can help bridge this gap.</p> <p> </p> <p>Communities serve a multitude of purposes: they provide events where like-minded people can come together and mentor one another; they provide a platform to explore new ideas and troubleshoot problems, thereby increasing learning experiences and knowledge bases. But further to this, they serve as a forum for thought-leadership that can help improve the technology capabilities and development of cutting-edge solutions, thus keeping the South African software industry on par with its international competitors.</p> <p> </p> <p>The software development industry is continuously breaking down boundaries and paving the way in innovation. Entrepreneurs and innovators don’t need to wait for government policy; individuals can push ahead and define their own future.</p> <p> </p> <p>Even within the context of large corporates, students with degrees in applied maths no longer go straight into a modelling role. They can consider statistical market analysis, data analysis and data science, to name a few.</p> <p> </p> <p>When we consider this in the African context, there are countless opportunities, given that the continent is so diverse and that there are endless opportunities in social entrepreneurship, medical healthcare, logistics, retail and banking.</p> <p> </p> <p>Regardless of your formal training or your working environment, as a developer, one thing remains true: the software engineering industry is evolving at a pace not seen in many other industries. South Africa’s greatest challenge will be to meet those opportunities with the skills and talent necessary to deliver on those jobs.</p> <p> </p> <p>For this pace of innovation to be sustained, industry thought leaders and influencers need to help guide young, talented individuals via mentorship and learning opportunities to help them compete effectively in the industry.</p> <p> </p> <p>By putting more emphasis and support behind communities, we can not only bring these mentors and mentees together, but help inform parents about software engineering as a career prospect, give girls the confidence they need, and provide a forum where eager youngsters can access devices to start developing and feel pride at what they have created.</p> <p> </p> <p>It makes good business sense to leverage the power of communities to help bridge the gap in formal training and get youngsters into jobs to stimulate South Africa’s economy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Transitioning from a technical to a management role</title>

              <pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many software engineers, there comes a time when they must decide whether to remain technical or pursue a role that primarily requires managing others.  They are no longer solely responsible for their own contributions, but also that of others and the team as a whole.  The transition to 'manager of others' must certainly be one of the more stressful milestones in one’s career - a hypothesis partly supported by the numerous articles online on this topic.</p> <p>However, very little is said from the perspective of those responsible for promoting an individual into a leadership role.  What are some of the common challenges and fears facing new managers, and what can leaders of leaders do to support them during the transition?</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Areas of discomfort for new managers</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Software engineers — especially the high achievers, those most likely to be promoted into a leadership role — are natural ‘yes’ people, willing to take on a new challenge without always knowing what’s on the other side of the door.  There is plenty to debate about whether moving into a management position is indeed a step-up on the career ladder, but let’s assume it’s happening, and for the right reasons.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Influence over control</strong></p> <p>The most notable adjustment is shifting from a position of control to a position of influence.  As a ‘doer’ of the work, you are in direct control of what you’re building.  Your responsibilities are task oriented, hands-on, and your actions have an immediate and tangible effect on your output.</p> <p>As a manager of others, your job is to influence.  Leadership style plays a large part in your effectiveness as a manager, and often requires the new manager to cede a significant level of control of how the job gets done.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Losing technical skills</strong></p> <p>Spending more time managing delivery and team members naturally takes away time from being able to practice the technical skills that have been part of your technical career until now.  This is a real fear many new managers face — their livelihood has been anchored on these technical skills for most, if not all, of their career up until this point. Addressing this fear is important to avoid regret later down the line.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Holding others to account</strong></p> <p>Giving constructive feedback to others, both positive and negative, is something that many new managers can find extremely uncomfortable. It takes part skill and part courage and includes holding others to account for not meeting expectations.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Priorities, time management and context switching</strong></p> <p>Technical individuals will naturally gravitate towards technical tasks since this is where they feel most comfortable. They have a high level of confidence that they will succeed, and believe that technical tasks is where their time is best spent. Plus, there is a common misconception that time not spent designing a solution or writing code is time wasted. However, this also happens to require larger chunks of focus time, which is a luxury that managers don’t always have. So, the ability to prioritize what’s important and context switch appropriately in the new role is a common challenge faced by most new managers.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Dealing with imprecise elements</strong></p> <p>Software engineers are used to binary outcomes: it either works or it doesn’t, and the timeframes for feedback on these outcomes in the software world are fairly instant.  As a manager, the focus shifts from binary outcomes to one of motivating others, building relationships, making decisions with limited information and planning more than one or two sprints ahead.  New managers from a technical background often struggle to adjust to making long-view decisions, especially with imperfect information.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Supporting the transition to management</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>It’s easy to assume an individual who excelled in a technical role will naturally perform at a similar level in a leadership role, especially if they are career driven, enthusiastic, and eager to take on new challenges.  Ideally they’ve been operating with some or all of these responsibilities before taking full accountability, but this isn’t always practical given the current demand for both technical and leadership skills in the software development world.  What can we do as leaders of leaders to better support them in their new role?</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>First be a mentor, then a boss</strong></p> <p>Software engineers come from a learning process of reading books, doing online courses, experimenting with code and tools and on the job experiences.  A large part of their growth comes from interacting with other team members discussing technical designs and the merits of one approach over another.  The soft skills required for a leadership role cannot easily be digested through the same learning approach.  Providing a hands-on, mentorship role during the early stages can help guide in ways that cannot be found in a text book, or through formal job descriptions and performance appraisals.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Set proper boundaries</strong></p> <p>New managers often struggle with knowing what decisions they can and cannot make.  Make the boundaries of the role explicit and give permission to make mistakes.  Encourage them to continue developing their technical skills through various means, but be clear that a key focus of the role is growing and developing others.  Talk through the challenges of time management and get them to commit an appropriate amount of time in the right areas, especially those outside their comfort zone.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Teach them how to give effective feedback</strong></p> <p>Just as you expect a new manager to hold others to account, do the same for them — lead by example and show first-hand how to give effective feedback to team members.  Spend time in feedback sessions, preparing discussion points and suitable techniques for dealing with potentially difficult discussions, and doing retrospectives on how various scenarios could have been tackled differently.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Let go</strong></p> <p>If you’re promoting someone in an area you’ve directly been responsible for in the past, give them the space to find their own leadership style.  Don’t micro-manage.  In the same way you’re guiding them to trust their team, trust the new manager to decide how to achieve his or her own objectives.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Develop management skills, emphasize leadership</strong></p> <p>There are a broad range of skills to master to become an effective manager.  The one area of development that will benefit the new manager the most is leadership.  Teaching them how to influence and develop others in a manner that builds trust and strong relationships will go further than any other skill.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>New managers can experience a significant amount of discomfort and stress when moving from a technical to a management role, which may not manifest immediately.  If they’re taking on this new role and staying with their current team and environment, be sure to explain their new responsibilities to both team and client.  Having a suitable strategy in place to support an individual during this transition can go a long way in helping them be the best leader they can be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Six leadership activities to sustain high-performance software teams</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High Performing Teams (HPTs) are the pinnacle of many businesses today. This is especially true in the software space, where competition for talent and skills is prominent. HPTs are those that take on a life of their own and are largely self-sustaining (10 Leadership Techniques). However, this doesn’t happen by accident. Teams can only be self-sustaining if they’re operating in an environment that fosters certain leadership features.</p> <p> </p> <p>Successful leaders build their teams around one simple goal: to create a space where people are charged with energy, can thrive, have a sense of belonging, and love to work as a team (Forbes).</p> <p>In the software industry, the pressure to deliver flawless software craftsmanship is intense. As such, building HPTs is essential, but sustaining those teams and ensuring job satisfaction and the promise of meaningful work is what can keep a solid team together and delivering consistently.   </p> <p> </p> <p>Here are six activities leaders can perform to create these spaces to help sustain their HPTs:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>1. Set goals for individuals and the team as a whole</p> <p> </p> <p>Once you’ve built an HPT, it's important to understand that, in order for the team to remain so, it’s best to adopt iterative processes – with each new project, deadline or team member. Using team goal frameworks can help you identify areas for improvement and, ultimately, lead to growth and increased job satisfaction.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our team has had great success using good ol’ SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Conducting individual SWOT analyses and discussing each team member’s personal analysis provides a better idea of perceptions in the team and where energy should be focused: It can be informative to see how people interpret their own situations. Using this in my own team has helped me identify areas to improve team dynamics.</p> <p> </p> <p>Another well-known framework is SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely) goals. Develop SMART goals collaboratively with your team to build inclusive objectives. Your team's goals need to be in the back of everyone's mind, whether you reiterate your goals in stand-ups, display progress on a dashboard or communicate them regularly. Keep track of people's goals and SWOT analyses as this will form the backbone for planning their personal development and guide performance conversations. At Entelect, we have an internal platform I use for capturing conversations like this, but Google Docs or Evernote also work well.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>2. Articulate and share your strategy</p> <p> </p> <p>Share your strategy with the team. This is often overlooked in favour of goals, but goals are not strategies. Goals define the destination; strategies define the path taken, trade-offs and unique activities involved in executing a plan to reach your goals. Sharing strategy includes the team in a joint vision to strive towards and may help in increasing motivation and accountability to achieve a higher goal. Understanding the twists and turns involved in following a strategy also provides team members with added meaning in their work, which in turn stimulates job satisfaction.</p> <p> </p> <p>Often, technical teams are the last ones to hear about new innovations, products or integrations in their pipeline. If you want the choir to sing on pitch, get everyone's buy-in and follow a unified strategy. It’s no secret that leaders can grow and retain great people by helping them have their say about the company or product’s long-term vision. Sometimes, the most unexpected people have the most awe-inspiring input to give.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>3. Optimise operational efficiency</p> <p> </p> <p>Operational efficiency is key to executing your strategy. But operational efficiencies are not static processes. They too are iterative and require constant review and diagnosis. There are a few areas where you can help to optimise general operations. Positive changes to these areas will help create a space where people can focus on their strengths and grow.</p> <p> </p> <p>On-boarding</p> <p> </p> <p>On-boarding can be one of the best ways to create a good first impression in any team environment. In an HPT, the on-boarding process must convert new team members into fully functioning team members as quickly as possible.</p> <p> </p> <p>Some of the essential activities for new members of High Performing Teams are:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>         Becoming comfortable working together and accomplishing tasks with minimal hand-holding.</li> <li>         Communicating well in the team and utilising their tools and practices.</li> <li>         Picking up the business domain relatively quickly and interacting with key stakeholders with confidence.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Consider using tools to help your new teammate progress through their on-boarding, such as a Trello board (here). My team and I introduced an on-boarding process using Trello at one of our big corporate clients where we on-board 30-plus people throughout the year. It helped us keep track of where our team members are at and quickly see if someone needs help.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowledge sharing</p> <p> </p> <p>Centralised and structured knowledge sharing greatly improves productivity and efficiency. In larger companies and teams, you often find a lot of duplicated efforts because of weak or non-existent knowledge-sharing facilities or practices. Be sure to share standards and tools used across the company and team to reduce rework and build on solid foundations contributed by others.</p> <p> </p> <p>We have used wikis to great success to create ad hoc specification, document startup guides for developers and business analysts, share nifty SQL scripts, document go-to guys and business owners in our teams and partners - pretty much anything that would be of value for someone else, we try and offload here.</p> <p> </p> <p>Instill the values in your team to look after their collective knowledge and you’ll add to their sense of job satisfaction and help sustain the level of quality delivery and pace that an HPT is renowned for.</p> <p> </p> <p>Communication</p> <p> </p> <p>Provide high-bandwidth, low-latency communication tools. High-bandwidth communication channels allow a great amount of information to be transferred between parties but often have long delays associated with it. Email is a prime example of this. Low-latency communication channels allow for quick turnaround times.</p> <p> </p> <p>Help your team to find a balance and the tools to improve the quality of communication. Recently, our team had the opportunity to work closely with teams on different continents and in different timezones. With this new challenge, we had to re-evaluate our communication tools to promote shorter feedback loops and provide an adequate level of detail.</p> <p> </p> <p>Process and red tape</p> <p> </p> <p>Rigid and formal rules can kill a team’s productivity. Eliminate processes that diminish your team’s autonomy and authority. This definitely speaks to the agilist in that you need to value people over process. Put principles in place that allow people to adapt quickly and deliver quality.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>4. Empower people to make decisions</p> <p> </p> <p>Many business leaders overestimate their abilities to build teams and make decisions for them. If you fail to realise that you should not be the centre of all decision making, you will never be able to retain HPTs.</p> <p> </p> <p>Create an environment for growth and empowerment. Empowerment means giving people the means and mandate to make more decisions that influence their work on a daily basis.</p> <p> </p> <p>Leaders often mistake their roles as being the ones who direct the daily operations and tasks that get dished out to team members. But true leaders create an environment where other forms of leadership can emerge organically and flourish. Nurture and encourage leadership of all kinds.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are some basic rules for empowering your team members:</p> <p> </p> <p>1.    It should always be incremental - Don't dump someone in a situation that could be overwhelming.</p> <p>2.    There should be appropriate control in place - Facilitate and moderate appropriately.</p> <p>3.    Replace control with accountability - as ability increases, loosen your control and hand over responsibility AND accountability. There is no responsibility without accountability.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>5. Apply situational leadership techniques</p> <p> </p> <p>There is a wide range of leadership styles and almost everyone possesses leadership qualities that can be tapped into. One way to look at these leadership styles is to classify them according to their strengths in the three components outlined by Gerald M. Weinberg in “Becoming a technical leader”:</p> <p> </p> <p>Motivational leadership - a leader who can motivate a team due to his or her technical ability.</p> <p> </p> <p>Organisational leadership - a leader who can help create an environment for the team to perform at a high level (think tools, processes, mentorship and culture)</p> <p> </p> <p>Innovation leadership - a leader who controls the flow of new ideas and encourages innovation.</p> <p> </p> <p>Juggling these styles, given the situation and individuals at hand, can give your team the edge it needs to outperform. We have a handful of extremely talented and technical-minded developers in our team. Giving them the opportunity to lead our initiatives on a technical front has enabled us to adopt new technologies quickly, with the confidence that our top guys and girls have approved the team’s move.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>6. Promote constant learning and improvement</p> <p> </p> <p>Individual and team development plans can help you carve out a path for growing your team. Do you invest time, money and energy into your own people? Do you give them the same focus and attention you want them to provide your company?</p> <p> </p> <p>The most important thing a leader can do for their team members is to facilitate continuous feedback. Promoting constant learning and improvement makes people more likely to stay on board and engaged; remaining loyal and helping your company on its journey. The threat of people leaving your organisation will always be there. However, the key is to make a concerted effort to invest in each employee and make them feel like a valuable, indispensable asset (while they’re there). Spend time with them, nurture them, and watch as the magic happens.</p> <p> </p> <p>These six leadership activities all include constant review and diagnosis. Nothing can be static. An HPT can only be sustained if it is constantly evolving. Fostering the values outlined here will not only build High Performance Teams but also increase retention. These practices may seem daunting to implement, but start to incorporate them, one-by-one, in your team. Remember, small steps add up to big improvements over time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Perhaps ask yourself, what vital principles, practices or values have your teams benefitted from most?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Differentiate your company with a candidate-centric approach to interviews</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a market suffering from a skills shortage, companies competing for software skills need to think about how to separate themselves among potential candidates. To differentiate your company amidst a skills shortage, start to treat the interview as an opportunity to let potential candidates experience your culture.</p> <p> </p> <p>One way to do this is by positioning your company as an employer of choice. Often, the difference between a successful business and a very successful business is the vision to treat its candidates the way it treats its employees.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Feeding frenzy</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Due to stiff market competition, employers are interviewing at an incredible rate, meaning the company encounters potential candidates daily. But, because the race is on to find the best skills and eliminate unsuccessful candidates, companies take a pragmatic approach to interviews and fail to recognise the brand-building opportunity an interview can provide.</p> <p> </p> <p>We don’t often think about an interview from a candidate’s perspective: It’s a stressful time. Companies usually treat the interview as a process. But despite all the noise and rationale around customer-centricity, few companies have considered building an interview process that is candidate-centric.</p> <p> </p> <p>Afterall, culture is not defined from when someone joins your organisation, but from when they first interact with it.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>In their shoes</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>A candidate-centric interview would mean understanding what the candidate needs from the potential employer to make them feel like they have had a rounded and fulfilling experience, no matter what the outcome.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, while there are some basic interview faux pas that no one should rely on, such as smart software algorithms to narrow down the top candidates or the CV itself (you’re not trying to hire the best writers), there are also several game-changers that could separate your business from the crowd:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. First impressions count</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Consider that an experience of your culture can begin at your office’s reception. A culture is not a list of values that hangs on the wall; it’s something that each employee lives and breathes. Therefore, the first interaction a candidate has with brand – that is, with the company receptionist – should reflect your culture. Was she friendly? Did she make the candidate feel comfortable? Was she expecting the candidate?</p> <p> </p> <p>These small engagements can give an immediate impression of the company and put the candidate at ease during what is often a nerve-wracking time.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Break with interview tradition</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Find creative ways to interview people. Often, it’s only in relaxed situations that you can pinpoint a person’s attitude, ambitions and drive. Consider a 15-minute Skype conversation, a hackathon or a speed-dating session. And vary the opportunities to interact with people: some people are better in one-on-one environments but, despite their quiet dispositions, can be little packages of dynamite.</p> <p> </p> <p>Remember that your offer might not be the only one a candidate gets. The interview may be their only experience of your company and, therefore, could seal the deal when they are considering competing offers.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. Courtesy goes a long way</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The interview experience should not be drawn out. Make decisions quickly but be considerate and respectful of your candidate. That means providing direct, constructive and personal feedback. Generic template rejections are impersonal and can leave the candidate feeling anonymous to your organisation, even though they may have put their best foot forward.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mapping the candidate journey</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>So, what can companies do to turn an interview process into a candidate-centric brand experience?</p> <p> </p> <p>One tactic that companies can introduce to help ensure an interview experience to surpass all others, is by outlining a candidate journey map.</p> <p> </p> <p>Creating a candidate journey map considers the experience of the interviewee throughout the interview process and aims to understand their feelings at each stage.</p> <p> </p> <p>This includes:</p> <ul> <li>The interactions a candidate will have</li> <li>The emotions they may feel during these phases</li> <li>The impressions that may be created</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Analysing their step-by-step journey more closely can help you understand the candidate’s experience of your company and culture. After all, workplace dynamics are shifting and culture is more important than ever. Great offers can be turned down by great candidates if their experience of your brand is poor.</p> <p> </p> <p>Companies should remember that each interview is the beginning of a business relationship.  Even if the candidate is unsuccessful on this occasion, he or she might be a potential brand ambassador. The future network advantages can be extensive, including referrals to other potential candidates, future clients or strategic business introductions.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, consider the last candidate who walked through your door. Did they have an experience that they will want to share?</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Gearing up for Generation Z</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an industry where teams have been dominated by Millennials for several years, this may be the first time many of our colleagues have to deal with a new generation in the workplace. Proactive companies would do well to start planning ahead; how we train people, grow our future leaders and attract and retain employees will be shaped by the demands and concerns of this new workforce.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Preparing for Generation Z</strong></p> <p>Gen Z are a follow on from Millennials and, as such, will probably be similar in many ways. However, Gen Z are also the offspring of Gen X, and it’s clear to see how the attitudes of the parents have shaped Gen Z.</p> <p> </p> <p>Gen Z will be the first generation to never have known a world without smartphones and social media. Access to technology will be taken for granted by many people in this age group. Platforms such as Facebook are being ditched in favour of Instagram and Snapchat and the rise of “finsta” (fake or friends only) and “rinsta” (real) accounts shows that users understand the possible long-term ramifications of social media. Not only might your parents find out what you have been doing but, in years to come you might miss out on that varsity place or get denied your chosen job based on posts made years before.</p> <p> </p> <p>The way we consume information continues to evolve with Gen Z; attention spans continue to diminish it seems, so information delivery and interaction with systems need to be bite-sized, quick and to the point. Micro-apps, which offer targeted interaction to do certain tasks, are coming to the fore and these reinforce the bite-sized culture.</p> <p> </p> <p>Moving forwards, employees will not want to engage with large enterprise systems through one app interface that is complex to learn. Instead, highly focused interaction points will let people do what they need with minimum friction.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Education and culture shift</strong></p> <p>My opinion is that this approach will spill over into education, where I feel the value of traditional three- or four-year degrees will be put under even more pressure in the next 10 to 20 years. In IT especially, the speed of change means that developers are frequently asked to cross-skill into new areas. Learning is becoming a career-long reality for developers and is something employers need to embrace fully.</p> <p> </p> <p>With Gen X parents, who have engaged with their children in a mature fashion, we’ll be faced with new colleagues who will be confident and independent. Leadership of Gen Z-ers must focus on collaboration and mutual respect. Hierarchy does not work; this generation firmly believes that they have something to offer and that even people with more experience can still learn from them.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Attracting born-frees</strong></p> <p>Generation Z accounts for nearly a third of the world’s population, with the majority of them living in underdeveloped or developing countries. From a South African perspective, it is likely that our workforce will ultimately carry a greater percentage of Gen Z-ers than many of the developed Western economies.</p> <p> </p> <p>As the first complete generation to be ‘born-free’, Gen Z in South Africa will be the most culturally diverse generation we have seen. It’s difficult to find research into the attitudes of black Gen Z software developers in South Africa; however, my feeling is that, as the most globally connected generation yet – and with IT skills in short supply in many countries across the globe – the possibility is that the current ‘brain drain’ of software developers once they have a little experience is likely to continue into the next generation unless things change radically here in South Africa.  </p> <p> </p> <p>I’ve worked for Entelect for over three years now and, being at the top end of the age profile, I can see how Entelect works hard to support social initiatives, provide clear career paths, incorporate and make use of social media and adopt flexible working practices.</p> <p> </p> <p>Ultimately, we aim to cater for people on an individual basis and we take work-life balance very seriously. The fact that these efforts are all squarely aligned with stereotypical Millennial requirements is partly due to who we want to attract but also driven by who we already are.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our current approach puts us in a good position to attract Generation Z workers as they, too, will want to work for a company that looks past simply making a profit to working somewhere that contributes to the wider society, working to be the best that we can and having fun while we do it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Make peer review a cornerstone of your SDLC</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s well accepted these days that the peer or code review is an important part of any development team’s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The basic premise being that at a certain stage colleagues in the team look over and review code being written, typically before it is released into a more formal test phase. The core driver behind the peer review is the early detection of bugs, with the theory being that the earlier you can catch an issue, the cheaper it is to resolve and the less disruptive it is to the timeous delivery of the feature set.</p> <p>Despite such a compelling argument for peer reviews it is my experience that teams still struggle to implement and maintain an effective review process. Reviews are often deprioritised or rushed when there is pressure to deliver, developers form review cliques to review each other’s code and reviewing someone else’s code is often seen as not as important as delivering your own code.</p> <p><strong>The wider benefits of code reviews</strong></p> <p>There are many different forms that the review process can take and choosing the correct one for your team will depend on lots of factors including; team size, type of software being built and development methodology being followed. Independent of the exact process though I believe there are wider benefits, not always acknowledged, that the review process can bring to a team.</p> <p>-        <strong>Education</strong> – A peer review is an excellent time for people to learn from each other. Seniors in the team can use the forum to educate colleagues on best practices and patterns they would like to see adopted and a peer review gives juniors a stage to ask questions, learn and show what they are capable of.</p> <p>-        <strong>Improve team communications</strong> – If done right the simple act of getting developers together to discuss the code they are writing will help promote an environment of openness and collaboration – key elements of a well-functioning team. Using these sessions as a vehicle for celebrating success is also a great way to grow a stronger team dynamic.</p> <p>-        <strong>Raise maturity in the team</strong> – For people new to the process being told you could/should have done something differently is not easy to accept at first. However, with some coaching to highlight the benefits most people quickly come onboard. In a professional environment being mature enough to have these discussions is key.</p> <p>-        <strong>Reduce key person dependencies</strong> – Peer reviews are a way of lowering the key person dependency on the code being written. Spreading the knowledge of what is being developed in the wider team ensures that the team is better placed to deal with people taking unforeseen leave.</p> <p>-        <strong>Drive improvements</strong> – What happens in the reviews should feedback into the team’s push for continual improvements. Patterns in the sorts of comments being made can drive training in the team or the adoption of a tool to run static code analysis. Looking at bugs raised later in the development lifecycle can also be used to update the review process to look out for certain issues.</p> <p>-        <strong>Promote team ownership</strong> – Socialising their code as part of a review process should be the beginning of a transition from code being solely owned by the author to a point where the team feels joint ownership for that code. This is quite subtle and not something that is always discussed in teams but I think is key. The review should not be about poking holes in another person’s work, rather a discussion along the lines of “Is the team willing to take responsibility for this new code?” After all, once this code is in production the norm tends to be that any member of the team will be asked to support it in future weeks.</p> <p><strong>Health check your reviews</strong></p> <p>I believe there are warning signs that, despite being a mandatory part of your SDLC, your peer review process might not be adding the value it could. Developer apathy towards them is a sure sign that the review is not the first-class citizen it should be. Are the same people doing the reviews all the time? While you will naturally find some people to be more engaged its vital that reviews are done by everyone in the team so you’re getting the best possible coverage and input to the process.</p> <p>How long are people reviewing for and how big are the commits? Recently a colleague of mine mentioned flippantly “for a single line change you’ll often get 3 comments and then 0 comments on the next review which happens to be 2000 lines long”. Keeping commit sizes down is vital. Studies have shown that there is a bell curve when it comes to ‘velocity (lines of code per hour) vs time spent’ with reviews[1]. If your colleagues are taking longer than 60 mins for a review you’re likely getting a diminishing return on that investment. Review fatigue is a real thing!</p> <p><strong>Ways to power up your reviews</strong></p> <p>Acknowledging that the review process has so much more to bring to your team than simple ‘checks and balances’ is key. Where possible reduce friction for the team around the review process, invest in tooling that supports reviews, such as Atlassian’s BitBucket and consider formalising slots in people’s diaries where they are expected to be reviewing and not working on their own code. Empower senior developers in the team to leverage reviews as a way of educating and promoting best practice and ask them to train your team on actually how to review effectively. Consider the metrics you can put in place to measure the effectiveness of the review process and share that information across the team so the process can evolve. Perhaps most importantly engage in dialog with your team to make sure everyone buys into and contributes to the reviews.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Sources:</p> <p>[1] <a href="https://rhodecode.com/blog/69/code-review-how-to-convince-a-skeptic">https://rhodecode.com/blog/69/code-review-how-to-convince-a-skeptic</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Tech entrepreneurship: you are not prepared</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Matthew Butler (Entelect, General Manager)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>These days, new mobile app ideas, modern social tools, automation, digital transformation of the enterprise, rapid prototyping, and new businesses can be born overnight with just a website.</p> <p> </p> <p>We read about the successful ideas all the time in the news, but we don't often get sight of the composition of these businesses. What below-the-surface decision making went down? We rarely get to peer behind the curtain to see an honest record of their journey. From dreaming and designing to budgeting, building and shipping and the complexities monetising their technology. Press-releases show the highlights, but they paper over the cracks and often obfuscate the real story.</p> <p> </p> <p>I'll get to the point. Building software-defined technology products from an idea, is not as trivial as it might seem from the outside. With adequate planning, awareness and caution, almost all these risks can be mitigated and understood. Without them, the attraction can be a financially (and reputationally) dangerous trap. New technology businesses have potential for terrifying operational, legal, financial and skills-depth behind the veil, and these aren't the kinds of things you want to be learning about and tackling half-way through your execution, and your budget!</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Let's look at a widely known example, Uber.</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>A groundbreaking idea which is simple for anybody to grasp. The premise is to use a smartphone application to call a taxi to your location, which is conveniently available from the on-device GPS, take the ride, and then pay electronically. It is one of those ideas where we think to ourselves "why hasn't it been done before". This is where it starts. When something sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Uber lost $1.46 billion in Q3 2017 alone, I wonder how many know that? It's not an exception either. The business lost more than a billion dollars in Q2, and $708 million in the first quarter. So where are all these costs coming from if Uber is just an app?!</p> <p> </p> <p>There is a misconception for some of the less-technical among us that tech products are a scheme where the idea comprises everything. That the first-to-market wins and implementation doesn't need much attention. There is a blind-spot to other aspects of an application, website or technology which, while usually not deliberately ignored, are just not thought of.</p> <p> </p> <p>In reality, there is hidden complexity in building a product, or a business, out of software beyond both the idea and the technical implementation. The purpose isto share and explore a few of the most common ones to invigorate your thought process.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The complex areas to tackle when starting a business.</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Costs: </strong>This is a tricky topic, primarily because of just how context-sensitive (and ambition-sensitive) costs can be. It is important to research the input, time and technology costs which might be applicable. Seemingly small details such as designs, third parties, lead-times, or where previously unknown components of a project (e.g. licensing, specialised tools and hosting) all introduce unplanned capital or operational budget impact. This information is powerful when negotiating, so doing the research, and gathering input from individuals or partners with experience should be one of the first steps taken. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Skills: </strong>Technology is supple and subjective, but even so, not all implementation teams are the same. Talented engineers, project managers, specialists and designers are very hard to find, this is evident by the rampant growth in demand for software engineers globally. For the same money and time, different teams will achieve vastly different results. This makes it important to research, network and take care when creating your own internal teams or outsourcing development. Technical and product teams need to be aligned, communicating freely with no loss of understanding, and share a common sense of direction, passion and urgency.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Operations: </strong>Once your app, website or service is built and launched, who will operate it? When customers have questions: who do they talk to? How do they contact them? How will you manage partners and third parties who have a role to play? Tech’ businesses still need a finance team and operational teams. People are still critical in the healthy functioning of any technology. Google has a search page which should be fully automated right? Type something in and some computers do the work and send back results. How many people could you possibly need? Google employed more than 70 000 staff in 2017. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Legal and compliance: </strong>Compliance is messy, and made worse by technologies that have to operate across borders and regulatory or legal jurisdictions. Around the world, governments have different laws regulating privacy, security and data. Seek advice here, explore previous examples and learn from them. This one is often left until last, whether out of priority or ignorance, and can delay a launch, cripple an idea or incur costly technology changes.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Time: </strong>Some things just take the fullness of time. Ideas need to settle, systems need to harden, team's need to storm and form, people need to build trust and feedback follows a cycle. Larger teams don't work proportionally faster (nine women cannot deliver a baby in one month!). Rushing blinds us, and can cause teams to make compromises they didn't fully understand. By no means is 'lethargic' a viable business strategy but sustainable pacing is. Iterating frequently and learning from failures are powerful tools in a product development arsenal.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Purity of vision: </strong>So much is made possible in a technology-based service or product, because it is malleable. Product owners can become trapped in paralysis, stuck between great ideas. Running too many tasks in parallel and never quite reaching a point of commercial or practical completion. This process can pull projects apart when even meaningful and independently brilliant ideas start to distract attention from a core vision. Something Twitter initially managed superbly.</p> <p> </p> <p>These are the real threats, but there are more: preparing for scale, marketing, user experience, hosting and infrastructure, market research, technological possibilities, and more.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly, managing these aspects doesn't actually need to cost more. So Lean Startup fans rejoice. A combination of foresight, avoiding certain expensive but avoidable emergencies, and methodical work typically result in a higher quality product. This means that in the end its not at all about making a larger upfront investment. It comes down to moving through the investment, aligned to a plan, with more insight and confidence.</p> <p> </p> <p>The objective here is not to scare people away. Technology is a magical key which unlocks ideas and businesses in remarkable ways. Instead, the ambition is to encourage new product owners, entrepreneurs, analysts and project managers to go into these projects with more clarity, a bit more caution, and a better knowledge of the journey. </p> <p> </p> <p>If starting a journey like this or developing an idea which could be the next big tech story, become informed, ask these questions and feel confident in your preparation to handle operational hurdles and legal arguments. Be sure you've got the right team and protect your vision. Explore and manage your own expectations for the journey. Those who aspire to create technology products will be well served by mixing this kind of awareness into their excitement and anticipation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Career lessons from centre stage</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Tim Kroon (Entelect, COO) </strong></p> <p> </p> <p>To be upfront, it is not my intention to bestow sagely wisdom upon aspiring entrepreneurs and software professionals, rather I thought this would be a fun exploration of how business-endeavors in the realm of music could parallel some of what we see in the tech industry.</p> <p> </p> <p>Presentation of credentials forthcoming:, in a former life I fronted a rock-band that toured South Africa for many years. We had some measure of success with local fans and radio but I can’t say that we imprinted ourselves upon the zeitgeist. We put out a couple of records, worked with some great people and played a few hundred shows around the country. We didn't have a tour-bus, we had a tour-bakkie. But, there is something special about forming a band, defining a mission and embarking on it as a team and I hope you find some of these insights valuable if not entertaining.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Fundamentals over fashion</strong></p> <p>Good song writing is something that although on the surface appears to have changed dramatically over the decades, when you listen a little closer it is very much the same from the Beatles to Taylor Swift. A good song allows you to ignore all its imperfections and predictability because it grabs you with resonance -  a combination of three characteristics: honesty, vulnerability and musicality. One of the reasons that U2 have been a mainstay for over 40 years is because of their commitment to this principle, they still bring stadiums of people to tears (happy tears for the fans, sad tears for the bono-haters) with the sounds of guitars, drums and voice.</p> <p> </p> <p>When looking for advice on how to steer our products or businesses, you’ll most certainly be met with pages and pages of neatly bulleted lists, littered with tech buzzwords and inspirational tokens like reinvention, disruption and innovation. Now I don’t have a bad thing to say about innovation in the tech business, however I do question why it is always so high on our priority list when there are so many other more important problems we face. Some things that just as important as innovation are the fundamentals of on-time and quality service delivery, practical problem solving and honest, friendly customer service. My take on this one is become great at your core business before you try and change it. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Perseverance is paramount</strong></p> <p>I first heard Snow Patrol’s “Final Straw” in my dorm room in 2002, and it was around 2005 that their music started hitting the international airwaves. You’ll be surprised to hear that for a band that achieved such phenomenal global success at the time, they had been recording and touring for 12 years already, playing mostly in pubs and university campuses to a handful of people. Their 2005 release “Eyes Open” saw their situation change dramatically with support from a ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ song placement, their album became an “overnight success”. There was nothing “overnight” about their success though and their story is not unique, it is shared by many other artists.</p> <p> </p> <p>I haven’t heard of a formula that makes success any easier to achieve, but I do know that those who have been successful, have had to stick it out for a while. Sure, there are elements to the success equation that are not entirely in our control, for example natural ability or talent is more a product of nature than it is anything else. This doesn’t put those of us who aren’t naturally gifted out of the running though, it just means that we may have to work a little harder and stay a little longer to get there. True, aspirational success is a rare confluence of opportunity, talent and circumstance. The longer you’re in the game, the more likely you are to experience it. I see this with the exceptional individuals in our business and customers. There are so many different products, companies and technologies to work with out there in the market and it’s hard to decide which horse to hitch your wagon to. It’s harder to know when to leave and when to stay with your company, when to admit failure and move on with your venture. What I can say is this: make sure you’re where you’re meant to be, and when you are, put your faith in your team, company or colleagues and saddle in for the long haul.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Ego is your enemy</strong></p> <p>Out of check egos have been responsible for robbing us of many of our favourite bands over the years (Guns ‘n Roses, The Police, Oasis to name only a few). It’s easy to understand how emotions can get the better of you when you’re being worshiped by thousands of people every night, and they all want a piece of you. I remember seeing Oasis live in 2009 and one of the magnetic aspects of their performance was Liam’s obvious disdain for the audience. He was the true embodiment of a narcissistic rock-star and it was almost romantic. We wanted that from him, we paid for it. Liam’s narcissism however was not just a performance, it was a disease which ended up destroying his relationship with his band and brother. Although, you have to admit that he's got a sense of humour about it. An excerpt from the book of Gallagher: "I suppose I do get sad, but not for too long. I just look in the mirror and go, `What a (expletive) good-looking (expletive) you are.` And then I brighten up."</p> <p> </p> <p>Self-confidence is attractive, and it builds confidence in the people we interact with. It’s also healthy for us to respect our own opinions and methods. A good dose of it is absolutely necessary for success but be careful not to drink too deeply. Teams that exhibit a deeper sense of respect for each-other’s contributions, opinions and personalities are far better equipped to weather the storm while those who succumb to ego and delusion will dissolve.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Have fun, be interesting and break some stuff</strong></p> <p>Rock bands remind us that it’s important to question, break the rules and let loose from time to time. Whether it’s punk, grunge, metal or pop, people are usually drawn to it for similar reasons. We want to know what it’s like on the other side, to live a little vicariously, be a part of a movement and maybe even be reminded that we’re in control of our own lives. And the industry needs examples and stories of risk-takers, rule-breakers and mad-men - people who push and test limits to show us what's possible. Legends, pariahs and martyrs who show us what we can, can’t, should and shouldn’t do. I’m not advocating bat-biting (Ozzy Osbourne) or throwing grand pianos into hotel pools (Keith Moon), but the world would be a much duller place without them.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>To close with a quote from our very own industry, while discussing the prospect of Bitcoin’s price reaching $500,000 in the next 3 years - McAfee & Associates founder John McAfee said "If not, I will eat my own (insert part of male anatomy here) on national television". Now there is someone who is willing to put more than their money where their mouth is.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>What have I learned about running remote teams?</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By</strong> <strong>Matthew Longden (Entelect, Delivery Manager)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>As far back as 1964 Arthur C Clarke predicted the digital nomad trend was coming to the work place. <em>“Perhaps only 50 years from now a man [may] conduct his business from Tahiti or Bali just as well as he could from London”. He went further: “Men will no longer commute; <strong>they will communicate, […] They will only travel for pleasure.”</strong></em></p> <p> </p> <p>It's just over 50 years later, and while we’re perhaps not fully nomadic in our choice of where to work, the idea of remote work is more and more prevalent, certainly in the IT sector.</p> <p> </p> <p>For several years, Entelect has been implementing a version of remote work, essentially our offsite project model is that. We gather requirements for a system and then we proceed to design and build it with teams based at our offices in Melrose Arch, Centurion and Cape Town. As we’re advocates of Agile SDLCs we try to communicate progress frequently and prefer a high level of interaction with product owners or client stakeholders to get prompt feedback on development. We’re good at this model and we’ve provided many high-quality systems to our clients in this way.</p> <p> </p> <p>More recently though we’ve been engaging with clients and colleagues in different ways. For instance, when a colleague decided to move to Eastern Europe last year he continued to work for us, producing mobile dev, for the first six months of his new life there. We now have several engagements where we have expanded our onsite team augmentation model to include remote teams.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>It’s this remote augmentation model that I am particularly interested in.</strong></p> <p>First, let me paint the perfect remote augmentation picture from my point of view. Teams that really nail this will be able to onboard and work with colleagues who are not coming into the same office as them. Being able to learn the domain, access systems and communicate with the wider team, will not be impacted by lack of physical presence. Remote members of a team will contribute and be valued in exactly the same way as their colleagues and they will undertake all the same tasks as the core team.</p> <p>The idea of such a team is attractive to me as a Delivery Manager because it opens up possibilities to support our clients in new ways. By tapping into the major commercial hubs in South Africa we can find the best composition of skillsets and experience to help them achieve their development aims. No doubt, it has to be better for our economy and the growth of South Africa’s IT industry to recruit people in this country rather than looking abroad, and as the IT skills pool is relatively isolated in this country we need to be flexible in our approaches to teams.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What have I learned so far?</strong></p> <p>To assume that remote augmentation will work in just the same way local augmentation does (we all just use jira and get on with it, right?) is simplistic in the extreme. By its nature, augmenting into a team typically requires much closer interaction, both in terms of frequency of communication and in the nature of tasks being taken on. It should be perfectly normal for the person sitting 400km away to develop the service tier which the front end developer sitting locally will consume, or visa versa. However, achieving this is not always trivial.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>(The right) tech can help</strong></p> <p>Tech has been the enabler of people working remotely so its unsurprising that it sits at the center of any solution to remote working. Its vital to have the correct array of communication mediums available and that the team members are able to use them appropriately. The humble telephone still has a huge part to play but provisioning a team with IM, video conferencing, group messaging such as Slack, as well as the now common tools like Jira and BitBucket is key removing the inherent friction in communicating from a remote location. Products such as Basecamp are also available, they aim to provide a single platform off which you can run a distributed team. It goes without saying that high speed, stable network access for the remote teams is a ‘must’ as well. Security policies, especially of corporates, need to align to allow remote workers access to all the systems they need to do their job.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The remote team is not a second class citizen</strong></p> <p>The ideal here is that remote colleagues simply pull tasks off the same backlog as the core team. I have seen instances though where the core team allocate simpler tasks to the remote team under the reasoning that they’ll be easier to do in isolation (this is also a common model when dealing with high capacity offshore teams in places like India and the Philippines). This sets a tone where the remote guys feel like they are never given access to the more complex, interesting work. Over time this will lead to them feeling disengaged and is likely to lead to frustrations around their ability to contribute to the development effort.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Making it work is also a people problem</strong></p> <p>I find the really insightful part of Clarke’s 1964 prediction not to be the idea of remote work itself but that of people needing to communicate. Despite the fact that we grow up with so many ways of communicating these days we are generally still very bad at communicating effectively, especially when not working face-to-face. This is, and will remain for some time, the main barrier to how well any given remote team will work in my opinion.</p> <p>In an industry not known for high EQ levels across the workforce, it is especially important to make sure there are nominated people in both the local and remote teams that will help facilitate excellent communications. This will ensure expectations across the team boundaries are managed.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Management support and buy in</strong></p> <p>I encounter managers who are open to trying a remote team however they feel there is no extra overhead needed to make the engagement a success. In addition to the above points around tech, equality between teams and great communication pathways, it is important that the management team themselves are clear in where potential issues may lie and are proactive in dealing with them. My experience of remote augmentation is that when things do start to go wrong you really need strong leadership to act quickly to put plans in place to address the issues at hand.</p> <p> </p> <p>Being able to build teams that can operate in this fashion does require different skills, approaches and tech than simply running a local team. If you manage to get it right though the potential to unlock talent pools in other South African cities, and ultimately further afield, is an exciting prospect for Development Managers struggling to find the skills they need locally.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Nobody Reads Anymore Right?</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 14:44:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Shashi Hansjee (Entelect, CEO)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>We have a few questions that we ask people joining our company, to get to know them better. One of which is their favourite book. Granted, we are a technology company and so naturally will have a larger than average number of readers, but pretty much every person speaks passionately about one or two particular books that really spoke to them. Of course, most of these are fiction, but when people say that nobody reads anymore, it’s not true.<br />  </p> <p>One of my favourite quotes is from Warren Buffet. When asked about the key to success, he said “Read 500 pages every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.” He also followed up that statement with “All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.”</p> <p> </p> <p>From a business reading perspective, I never manage to get through as many books as I’d like to, but I do manage to read at least one or two per month. I’ve found there are a few tricks to developing a concentrated reading list, compared to the four or five per month many other thought-leading executives seem get through.</p> <p> </p> <p>Firstly, experiment. Amazon have an enormous range of books and their recommendations generally work well. Reading reviews, checking out the contents and reading the first chapter before you buy will help you identify those books that are outside the obvious bestsellers and can offer amazing insights.</p> <p> </p> <p>Secondly, be aware and be <em>creative</em>. If you take just one idea from a book and apply it to your business, then the time spent is worth it. At times, it might not be obviously applicable, but being aware, and thinking outside the box when reading, has led to some of the most successful initiatives in our business today.</p> <p> </p> <p>Finally, variety is important. Generally, people get hung up on reading one type of book – either strategy, or other peoples’ success stories, or topics that are only applicable to their area or role. Variety is key to expanding the mind and promoting creativity. Some of the more technical or specialised subject matter-focussed books are a heavier read, but often that extra detail and depth can yield the most practical ideas.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, invest in your knowledge by reading regularly. Challenge your existing knowledge by picking up books that sit outside of your comfort zone and think laterally while reading. There is no rule as to where a creative solution to a business problem can come from. What is certain, is that you don’t have to be at executive level to bring a great idea into a business or your team and change the way things are done for the better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Don’t be a commodity in your career. Stop doing and start growing.</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Matthew Butler (Entelect, General Manager : Managed Solutions)</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>You could coast through a career of 40 years, or become formidable in 5. This is a look at two mechanisms to stay on the accelerator, grow as a professional and make an impact wherever you are. These mechanisms are your attitude towards learning, and your willingness to understand context. These are two stand-out concepts I've learnt and observed in my own journey from junior to leadership. It is scary how this conventional wisdom is lost or diluted in many companies.<br /> <br /> Essentially these do boil down to critical thinking, but let’s take a moment to explore learning and context as two of the easier ways to change your mindset towards your work, get ahead of your peers, and stand out! We individually have control of these areas of our professional lives. In particular, attitudes or mindsets like these have nothing to do with industry knowledge, experience or technical skill. Your stance is your key to a massively accelerated career, if you want it.<br /> <br /> We land in our roles full of uncertainty but ambitious because of it. We are motivated to learn and are terrified of underperformance. The mystery of a new career energises us greatly through new purpose and problems. We must justify our selection to join a team and hold a position. Does this sound familiar?<br /> <br /> Sometime into your role you learn the recipe. You solve many of the mysteries, and deeply understand how a team or organisation operates. Through this clarification the novelty of the role wears off, and human nature dictates that we start to lose interest. We stop pushing ourselves as our expectations align with our customer’s or employer’s expectations. We stop growing and start doing. As these external factors - new people, new expectations and environments wear off, it’s time for internal factors to kick in..<br /> <br /> So here they are, two dynamos which you can apply to change your perspective; to stop doing and start growing:<br /> <br /> <strong>One: learn on your own time.</strong><br /> <br /> This is self-investment. You’re not waiting for your employer to force you on training or sponsor you, you’re doing it on your own time and your own dime. You’re realising that you are the captain of your career and have an obligation to do this for yourself. It also accelerates you within your organisation because you can offer more (incidentally why you were attractive to an organisation in the first place). If you are clearly investing in yourself it sends a critical message to your team and management that you care about your productivity in a vacuum. If you aren’t relying on your employer to carry you, it sets a very different balance of power.<br /> <br /> People who invest in themselves regardless of circumstance, employer or project are independent. They’re keeping themselves ahead of the curve, which is a hugely magnetic concept. You probably want to work with other people like this, because they have so much to offer. It’s not just wisdom or skill either. Independence breeds positivity and focus, characteristics which help projects succeed and businesses grow. If you commit openly with yourself, your team and your company to spend your own time learning and developing yourself, you become a giver and not a taker, a transformation.<br /> <br /> <strong>Two: obsess over context.</strong><br /> <br /> This one is a little more complex but still nothing ground-breaking. The idea here is to always remember why you’re doing something. Some call this big picture thinking but I believe it is more nuanced. Context is about self-awareness; it’s about business sense, selflessness and objective thinking. Introspect for a second, ask yourself if everything you’re doing and saying right now within your current project is in the best interests of the success of that project? Does your attitude show a care for, and understanding of circumstances? Business environment, customers, budget demands, time pressures. Does your team and leadership absolutely trust you to think for yourself; have you demonstrated that you can?<br /> <br /> This is harder to balance because what we need to do or say in the best interests of the project may not align so perfectly with our personal measurement of things. This is also a common perspective (or measurement) of maturity - our ability to put personal agenda aside in these circumstances and to prioritise the team or business’s needs. Once context is mixed into the picture, motivation will come more naturally as we demonstrate a balanced intent and clarity of purpose.<br /> <br /> Another introspection for you to try: when the dust settles, what will your contribution be? Douglas Kruger talks about this in his book “Own your Industry” (a cool read by the way). He talks about speaking the language of results when we are trying to sell something. He encourages us to think about outcomes as what people and businesses are attracted to, as opposed to the input, features or tasks. If you “do a thing” you’re a commodity, if you “get a result” you’re a in a position of power.<br /> <br /> These two mindsets are made even more interesting because they present a curious balance of their own. Self-investment can be considered selfish and unrelated to your role, but context is 100% selfless and focused on the narrow agenda. The important realisation is that our stance when it comes to these two elements of ourselves are powerful levers to pull. They influence how we are perceived in our roles and should be understood to be taken advantage of.<br /> <br /> Coast along a career through the slow march of time, or force some perspective. Motivate yourself to continuously learn for your own sake, and remember to deliberately empathise with business objectives. Make a bigger impact, get noticed, grow.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How organisations can empower employees to be the narrators of their story.</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 15:14:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><strong><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ArticlePic.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 340px; " /></strong></p> <p><br /> <strong>By Bianca McFadyen ( Marketing & Communications Manager)</strong><br />  </p> <p>In a time where access to information, and the noise from external inputs such as social media have never been louder, ensuring your messaging gets maximum exposure, can be challenging.<br /> <br /> Generally, people tend to trust stories told to them by people that they spend time with and have built relationships with. For companies, this can be used to their advantage by using employees to share their stories directly, giving the message a higher level of authenticity in the minds of your staff than an external party, or some kind of internal campaign, could achieve.<br /> <br /> When these stories are captured and cultivated, and employees are given the necessary guidance, businesses can use them to deliver actionable and relevant internal communications stories for five key areas.<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Bringing teams together</strong><br /> <br /> Stories of team and individual success are incredibly empowering for everyone within the business, and celebrating these wins openly and directly can unite all with a sense of shared pride and achievement.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Alignment to business objectives</strong><br /> <br /> Instead of the objectives being shared through bullet points in a slide deck, an engaging story told by employees of all levels, interwoven with the key goals and objectives will align everyone in the business to those common goals. Layering in the values of the company will have an even greater affect.</p> <p><br /> <strong>3. Building capability</strong><br /> <br /> This is especially powerful for technical teams. By sharing a new process or solution through an employee story (sharing key actions, lessons learned and the honest frustrations experienced getting to the end point), we allow other employees to gain knowledge through a very reliable source. This generates confidence for both the storyteller and those who can learn from them.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. Employee engagement and connection</strong><br /> <br /> By sharing something deeply personal or a story that stirs emotions, a storyteller can build connections across the business and bring everyone together through shared empathy.<br /> <br /> <strong>5. A new business process/procedure</strong><br /> <br /> A communications area that is usually delivered in a dry way can be far more engaging when delivered by employees who can authentically share the benefits they have gained or will gain from the new process.<br /> <br /> There are various ways to find and capture these stories, although maybe surprisingly, the simplest way works wonders. Openly asking all employees to contribute can be powerful, especially if it is to highlight the great work of others. People in leadership positions can also highlight top performers as a source of engaging stories to share across the business. It is important to ensure that the key messages are shared beforehand, so the team knows what to look out for, but as much as possible let employees tell the story in their own words.<br /> <br /> Guiding the narrators to tell compelling stories<br /> <br /> Not everyone is a natural storyteller in written or spoken form, so it is vitally important for companies to give the right support and guidance to empower employees to deliver their best stories authentically.<br /> Regardless of the format, there are a few critical elements that will help frame the narrative.<br /> <br /> •    Who is the audience? i.e. their team, division, or the entire business?<br /> •    What is the key moral of the story?<br /> •    Why will the audience find this useful?<br /> •    How did I achieve the success I am going to share? What were the biggest challenges I faced?<br /> •    What would I find most interesting about my story that I think others might find engaging?<br /> <br /> The last point is quite powerful because if you have employees aligned to the same objectives, an employee will know what others will find empowering and inspirational.<br /> <br /> If it is a story that is being shared by a live presentation or video, consider offering public speaking or presentation coaching beforehand to build confidence. Also, having experienced speakers available to positively share feedback during practice runs will allow companies to develop a stable of great storytellers across the business over time.<br /> <br /> Use this great asset within your business – your people, empower them and guide them towards narrating their own stories of learning, achievement and success. This is a technique organisations can use to create and share much more engaging and memorable messaging.<br /> <br /> Let your people tell your story for you.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

Members can search for specific industries, locations, remuneration, skills and experience, using portals such as LinkedIn which currently has over 6.7 million South African users or Careers24 with over 1.4 million unique visitors each month.</p> <p> </p> <p>But with great power comes great responsibility. This fast-paced, job-seeking environment also presents three major challenges:</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Due to the volume of applicants to many open roles, processing applications accurately and timeously to ensure a high-quality shortlist has become a more pressurised process</p> <p>2. Candidates can instantly find new opportunities in an ultra-competitive job market, causing many disconnected recruitment processes to lose prime candidates</p> <p>3. Existing employees are fully aware of how easily their next opportunity is to find, so retaining staff has become vitally important</p> <p> </p> <p>The last challenge naturally leads to the discussion around employee retention, but also how powerful employee advocacy is in a digital world. With global tech companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook leading the way with free food around the clock, massage therapists, games rooms and even sleep pods, companies small and large are by necessity looking at all kinds of ways to make the employee experience as enjoyable as it can be.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>User experience = Employee experience</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>As the world becomes more connected than ever, sharing experiences with others can have immense reach. Leading companies such as Microsoft are<a href="https://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/microsoft-throws-stack-ranking-out-the-window" target="_blank"> reimagining the way performance reviews </a>are processed. There is a growing movement globally to phase out the traditional style of annual performance reviews against a numerical scale, to a style of frequent, informal employee feedback during regular check-ins, and adjusting how merit-based pay increases are assessed. This allows for bugbears to be regularly ironed out.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are countless examples of negative customer service going viral on social media. Websites such as Glassdoor allow employees to review their working experiences in a public forum, giving insight into what it is like to work for any company. Companies have no influence over what is published and it is totally anonymous.</p> <p> </p> <p>This is one of the many critical reasons why HR functions should embrace and empower their people with the ability to give feedback on issues outside of the traditional review processes, and addressing those concerns through continual leadership communications.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Being connected through digital, starts and ends with engaged people</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>As the custodians of the most important but arguably the most complex resource within a business, HR functions need to be connected throughout a business. It comes with its fair share of challenges, but these can be overcome if HR functions focus on the empowerment of people through:</p> <p> </p> <p>· Aligning all individual objectives to those of the overall business and ensuring everyone understands their contribution to achieving these</p> <p>· Fostering a culture of open and continuous feedback that is embraced and actioned by leaders all year round</p> <p>· Be the champions of change to processes, to free up resources to focus on things that drive business outcomes and for leaders to support their people in their growth</p> <p>· Partner with IT and expert agencies to evolve legacy systems to save resources and digitise the employee experience end-to-end</p> <p>· Embrace digital as a positive catalyst for connecting all functions of the business to a common goal – with HR taking a central role in that connection</p> <p> </p> <p>At Entelect, we pride ourselves in being aligned with the global trend of identifying ways to deliver a connected, digital employee experience through our empowered HR function. But we take it one step further. We ensure that our performance reviews are designed to cultivate talent and not merely provide a review. We don't see the traditional HR function as the rest of the world sees it, but rather as a people function. We see our valued people as individuals who we look to constantly grow, and this is what sets us apart.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Performance reviews which make a real difference</title>

              <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PerformanceReviewssml.png" style="width: 800px; height: 418px;" /><br />  </p> <p>Daniel walks confidently down the corridor towards the meeting room booked out for the latest round of bi-annual performance reviews. He is dressed for success, notes in hand and undoubtedly prepared to showcase his achievements over the last six months. In contrast, Joshua looks uninterested, unprepared and ready to leave before he arrives. In both these vastly different review scenarios, there is a lot of preparation needed by a manager and employee in order to get the most out of performance reviews.<br />  </p> <p>Let’s take a step back. It’s 2019 – why are we even bothering with bi-annual performance reviews? Many argue that bi-annual performance reviews are outdated, and we should rather focus on the holy grail of performance reviews: the ongoing informal feedback loop. I agree wholeheartedly. The hard reality is that people just don’t know how to give valuable, honest and constructive feedback, <strong>continuously</strong>, or just don’t have the time to do it.<br />  </p> <p>Bi-annual performance reviews take dedicated time to prepare, discuss, review and plan; recognising an individual’s successes and providing the all-important career direction. <strong>Bi-annual performance reviews form part of the continuous feedback loop.</strong><br />  </p> <p>For Daniel, his motivator is success and status, and the performance review is all about measuring his progress towards his goals and highlighting achievements. His review period has been stellar, filled with successful project deployments, value-adding features that he initiated, and customer reviews beaming with commendations. Joshua has had an even better review period, but what motivates him isn’t success – it’s mastery and the depth of the technical challenges he has faced and come out on top of.<br />  </p> <p>In these scenarios, both Daniel and Joshua have done amazing work. If we as managers just highlight the achievements and don’t offer a way forward or don’t understand their motivators/career aspirations, we are doing a disservice to the excellent individual that stands before us. For someone that hasn’t had a good review period, if we focus only on the faults without explaining the implications and providing actionable feedback, guidance or opportunities, we are not doing our jobs of cultivating talent.<br />  </p> <p>It’s important to focus on the positives and the negatives, regardless of the performance of the individual. That is how you guide people to grow.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Before we can discuss how to prepare for a review, we need to understand what the outcomes of a review should be:</strong><br />  </p> <p>Part of our responsibility as managers is to cultivate talent, grow the people we work with and provide a clear, actionable path for people to go down on in their careers. We’re focused on the perspective of the reviewer and not the reviewee in this article, but it is important to note that it is the responsibility of both the reviewer and the reviewee to make sure that a review is beneficial.  <br />  </p> <p><strong>The following list of outcomes should be a focus of any performance review:</strong><br />  </p> <ul> <li><strong>Get a sense of individual achievements</strong>. People want to be recognised for the great work they do. Give them the recognition they deserve.</li> <li><strong>Understand the challenges the person may have or has overcome.</strong> If someone is still experiencing the challenges, identifying what they are is a great way to become an enabler for   them. Knowing the challenges they have overcome helps to remind them of the growth they experienced over the review period.</li> <li><strong>Identify the strong skills the individual has and help to leverage those.</strong> By highlighting the strengths people have and explaining how important those are in one’s career, reinforces great behaviour and shows an understanding of what the individual has to offer.</li> <li><strong>Identify the skills that need refinement.</strong> Nobody is great at everything, so there will always be skills that need refinement or growth as one moves down their career path.</li> <li><strong>Setting and tracking goals set out by the person</strong>. Setting goals is multifaceted. You could use a goal as an opportunity to grow a skill identified earlier, or help the individual do something that they are passionate about that is outside of their work. Goal setting helps put together something actionable to achieve but helps for accountability too.</li> <li><strong>Gauge sentiment.</strong> This one is simple, find out if the person is happy in the role they are in, the work they are doing or the interactions they have with their team. Action something if the person isn’t happy.</li> <li><strong>Deepen a relationship with the individual</strong>. This going without saying, building strong relationships with your team is a must. It helps to be honest, to understand the people on the team, what inspires them, how to communicate with them, where they come from, and what is important to them. It shows that you care. It also improves your credibility as a manager.<br />  </li> </ul> <p><strong>How to deliver the feedback, career guidance and support in the review:</strong><br />  </p> <p>When one leaves a review, they should feel as though they have been able to speak their mind, talk about what is important to them, have a clear understanding of the next steps and feel excited about the challenges ahead. Effective performance feedback looks both backward and forward, speaks to behaviours and skills as attributes, not the person, and explains the impact and consequences of those attributes.<br />  </p> <p><strong>The following guidelines should be exercised when providing feedback:</strong><br />  </p> <ul> <li><strong>Listen first and ask questions to clarify understanding.</strong> Most people crave the opportunity to talk and share their views; to feel as though they are listened to. It is a discussion, not a lecture. Be clear in your understanding of what the reviewee is saying and don’t make assumptions.</li> <li><strong>Be constructive by reviewing a skill and not the person. </strong>Feedback should be seen as an opportunity to learn more about yourself professionally, not be personal.</li> <li><strong>Give specific and concrete examples where performance was good or poor.</strong> Saying things like “you are a very good communicator” vs “you are great at explaining very technical terms to non-technical people and ensuring that everyone in the room understands the way forward while making people feel part of the team” is very different.</li> <li><strong>Explain the impact of good and poor behaviour.</strong> You don’t know what you don’t know. Talk about the reasons why something impacts the team or the project so that the reviewee gains experience and develops insight.</li> <li><strong>Provide opportunities or ways to stretch and improve skills.</strong> If you don’t give an opportunity or a clear way to achieve a goal, most people get stuck and say that the opportunities don’t exist in the current work environment. There is always an opportunity, one simply needs to explain what it is and the measurables from it.</li> <li><strong>Provide the appropriate support.</strong> Support comes in many formats. Providing training, having face time to soundboard ideas, removing blockers or introducing the right people at the right time. Be available and offer support to achieve goals.</li> <li><strong>Exercise EQ.</strong> This one is tricky, but the gist of it is that in a review, your feedback and tone need to be adjusted to each person you are reviewing. Feedback often comes with emotions, but when the intent is to be constructive, honest and to grow the person, delivery of the feedback becomes much easier.</li> <li><strong>Exercise accountability. </strong>Often review feedback requires tough conversations. Accountability is only effectively achieved when there is an agreement in place, a clear understanding of the boundaries and knowing how to measure success. Don’t be afraid to hold people accountable.<br />  </li> </ul> <p>Let’s explore how this strategy played out with Daniel and Joshua.<br />  </p> <p>Daniel is a rock star engineer, and a natural leader in the team, even though he is relatively early in his career. His review started out as a highlights reel where we discussed all his achievements and the impact that he has made to the project and client <strong>(listen first, recognise achievements)</strong>. We spoke about his strong technical skills, such as estimations in his own work and his ability to problem-solve <strong>(identify strong skills)</strong>, but also identified that he doesn’t know how to estimate other people’s throughput <strong>(identify skills to refine)</strong>. This resulted in him setting deadlines he couldn’t meet and then pouring his heart and soul into the project to make sure it got delivered on time <strong>(explain the impact)</strong>.<br />  </p> <p>Although admirable in his desire to get things done and see things through, it meant that Daniel wasn’t dedicating time to his other passion, rock climbing, and he would ultimately suffer burnout <strong>(understanding his challenges)</strong>. We put together a dedicated meeting slot to review every estimation made on his own work and that of the others on the team to see how he would improve over time and adjust accordingly <strong>(provide the appropriate support)</strong>. We also agreed that he should do the things he is passionate about and that I would call him out if he didn’t do at least one trip to the nearest indoor rock climbing gym once a month <strong>(agreeing to a goal and shared accountability)</strong>.<br />  </p> <p>Joshua, our technically-minded defender of quality and champion of best practices entered the room and didn’t say much. Highlighting all the achievements and technical brilliance he brought to the team from my point of view is how the review started <strong>(recognise achievements)</strong>. We proceeded to talk about the solutions he was delivering on the project and if he still felt as though the work was challenging <strong>(gauging sentiment)</strong>. He was very happy and felt as though he was still adding huge value. The next thing we spoke about was his career path. He wants to go down the path of being a Solutions Architect; so we chatted about the need to grow the skills of influencing change and being able to address non-technical people (identifying skills to grow). These skills would be grown by running project planning workshops, and joining the analysis meetings with the business analysts <strong>(provide the right opportunities to improve skills)</strong>. His strengths in holding people accountable would provide the legitimacy in a room of non-technical people as being the trusted advisor on the team <strong>(leveraging strong skills)</strong>.<br />  </p> <p>Preparation and clear feedback are key. Think of the outcomes you want to achieve from a performance review before it starts. Providing great tactile feedback gives clear direction and makes a review meaningful. To take it a step further, share your intent, and get the reviewee to prepare for the review following the same guidelines.<br />  </p> <p><strong>At Entelect, we are all about staying true to our core values through our performance reviews. Through being open & honest and building meaningful relationships during reviews means that <em>relationships set us apart</em>. By providing clear actionable feedback, we ensure that for those within our organisation, <em>growth isn’t optional</em>.</strong></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>3 ways to promote better engagement between UX Engineers and Software Engineers</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 8:08:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/3WAYSTOPROMOTEBETTERENGAGEMENTBETWEENUXENGINEERSANDSOFTWAREENGINEERS-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Collaboration between user experience (UX) and development is essential for building great solutions. Using the abilities from both disciplines in tandem provides a definite edge that is impossible without collaboration, communication, and compromise.</p> <p> </p> <p>Organisational structures differ from company to company, where larger organisations may have different departments for UX and development. However, the best approach is to have dedicated multi-disciplinary teams on projects, breaking down silos by having both UX Engineers and Software Engineers as part of the team.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Designing for development</em> is about finding the solution that produces the best possible user experience with the least moving parts. Because UX Engineers specialise in what makes sense for the user, and Software Engineers specialise in what makes sense for the computer, below are 3 ways to start building a team that grows together – and builds better software:</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1.    Act as one team</strong><br /> In many organisations, Software Engineers are often excluded until it’s time to develop what has been designed. Avoid exclusion by engaging as one agile delivery team from day one. Validate designs and uncover technical considerations sooner, that might cause roadblocks later on.</p> <p> </p> <p>UX Engineers should actively take the time to understand the development and technical feasibility, while Software Engineers take the time to understand user needs and design influences. Constantly working together throughout the process gauging technical feasibility, timelines and capabilities, allows the team to draw on each other’s strengths.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2.    Create a culture of open communication</strong><br /> UX Engineers and Software Engineers often see things very differently as a result of their own skills and strengths. These differing viewpoints can be leveraged to establish an open communication policy.</p> <p> </p> <p>By involving Software Engineers in design reviews and workshops, they are given the opportunity to provide earlier input. By urging UX Engineers to attend sprint planning, they will have a more holistic understanding of the project to keep refining their designs when new or changing requirements emerge throughout the development process.</p> <p> </p> <p>Work towards a shared understanding of goals, and establish clear and frequent updates. Collaborative design and development need constant feedback and input from both parties. This will ensure that business, design, and technology perspectives are integrated into the project from day one.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.    Compromise when needed</strong><br /> Being constantly involved in each other’s processes allows for a better understanding of requirements and constraints. Ultimately, there will always be compromises, or at the very least, adjustments required between what UX Engineers envision and Software Engineers implement. Most often, these are compromises to meet business objectives, while still meeting user needs.</p> <p> </p> <p>When project roadblocks do happen, take the time to understand why a missing feature is crucial or how an unnecessary element isn’t feasible given constraints of the platform. Understanding the reasoning behind the roadblock will make it easier to compromise and collectively come up with a solution.</p> <p> </p> <p>Without proper communication and leveraging each other’s skillsets, the user experience provided will lack efficiency, engagement, and value. Promoting transparency on tasks and timelines, and nurturing a feedback culture within the team as a whole, is critical to ensure you’re creating great products with the best user experience possible, without compromising on robustness and maintainability.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Creating a community of collaboration and coding</title>

              <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2019 15:10:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CodingCommunity-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>President Barack Obama asked in his State of the Union address that “we live in a time of extraordinary change, change that’s affecting the way we live and the way we work. New technology replaces any job where work can be automated.  Workers need more skills to get ahead.  These changes aren’t new, and they’re only going to accelerate.  So, the question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘How can we make sure everyone has a fair shot at success in this new economy?’”</p> <p><br />  The answer is coding and computer science education.</p> <p><br /> The good news is that if you are not able to attend courses or university after school, or if you are in a different role and want to upskill in software development, there are many organisations today assisting people at all levels to get involved in the world of code.</p> <p><br /> In South Africa alone, there’s a strong IT community with a plethora of knowledge-sharing events to attend, if you know about them. There are also several different organisations assisting and growing individuals in this space. So, who exactly are they and how can you get involved?</p> <p> </p> <p>•    <strong>GirlCode</strong> is a social enterprise that aims to empower young girls and women through technology. Their vision is to impact 10-million women across Africa in 10 years, starting with getting young girls interested in STEM. It aims to do this through strategic partnerships with the public sector; strengthening collaboration with similar organisations; and leveraging corporate assets in the development of ICT facilities, infrastructure and networks within schools in disadvantaged communities. GirlCode run workshops throughout the year, which are aimed at the community and are positioned to accommodate all skill levels in various technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more. <a href="https://girlcode.co.za/">https://girlcode.co.za/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>•    <strong>Geekulcha</strong> is where young, skilled, creative and ambitious tech minds meet to connect with each other, share knowledge, collaborate on projects, network with industry leaders, obtain training to further improve and enhance their skills and to put that newly acquired skill to work. The platform has over 11 200 tech enthusiasts and innovators across Africa. Their focus is on empowering young geeks through ICT skills development and training while giving them a taste of what awaits them in the big world through industry exposure. Their ultimate goal is to help the young innovators with skills for employment and innovation development. Geekulcha provides a variety of platforms and events for growth while being exposed to the corporate world. All Geekulcha events are free. <a href="https://geekulcha.com/events">https://geekulcha.com/events</a></p> <p> </p> <p>•    <strong>User Groups. </strong>Local and international organisations have also realised the need to help facilitate, train and assist in the education and upskilling of the community, especially here in South Africa where the skills shortage is prevalent. We value building relationships and the community around us and believe that if you can network with peers in the industry, you can learn from what they are doing. Participating in user groups is a great way to improve technical, presentation and networking skills. They are free to attend and anyone can join in. Visit <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za">https://culture.entelect.co.za</a> or sign up on <a href="https://www.meetup.com">https://www.meetup.com</a> to view events.</p> <p><br /> •    <strong>The Entelect Foundation </strong>is an initiative designed to provide support to the underprivileged in the community; be it financial aid, schoolwork or counselling. The primary focus of Foundation is on educating the community to equip them with skills that will help them become self-sufficient. On Saturday mornings Entelectuals volunteer to help tutor the learners from our offices, having put many children through better schools with better results in the past year. Through the Entelect Foundation, we even helped one learner through high school and university, who then finally joined Entelect as a graduate software engineer.</p> <p>For more information or to get involved, visit <a href="http://www.culture.entelect.co.za">www.culture.entelect.co.za</a></p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/News.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 243px;" /></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[President Barack Obama asked in his State of the Union address that “we live in a time of extraordinary change, change that’s affecting the way we live and the way we work. New technology replaces any job where work can be automated. Workers need more skills to get ahead. These changes aren’t new, and they’re only going to accelerate. So, the question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘How can we make sure everyone has a fair shot at success in this new economy?’” The answer is coding and computer science education.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>The future of the STEM workforce</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ThefutureoftheSTEMworkforcs-FINAL.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Many companies in the STEM environment, both across Africa and globally, have come to the realisation that striving towards a gender-balanced workforce is an inevitable goal for the future. And although this is what we are aiming towards, there is no simple solution or silver bullet to achieve this.</p> <p><br /> Additionally, ensuring diversity along age, religion, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, religion, languages and educational lines is also crucial for a holistic workforce representative of the global economy.</p> <p><br /> But why is this important and what impact does it have?</p> <p><br /> <strong>1.    Diversity of thought leads to greater problem solving</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>In any problem-solving situation, having a diverse set of experiences to draw from is always beneficial. Although it’s not always immediately obvious in a STEM setting, diversity of life experience is just as important as the technical and vocational experience within a team.</p> <p>This needs to be paired with a strong framework and a focused leadership to get the maximum value out of this diversity of thought.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Harvard Business Review explores this in more detail <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse">here</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2.    More profit</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>This might seem like a big claim, but a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/is-there-a-payoff-from-top-team-diversity">McKinsey & Company</a> study across Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States that included 180 companies, found that those with more diverse workforces enjoyed significantly higher earnings and returns on equity.</p> <p> </p> <p>Those that outperformed were able to make the right decisions faster which is an obvious advantage in any industry. This ultimately led to higher profits.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3.    Greater economic and employment benefits for the wider market</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has<a href="https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/methods-tools/about"> analysed multiple data sources</a> across the European Union and its member states to extrapolate two key positive economic outcomes for STEM within the EU. Although the European Union is a vastly different market to Africa, we believe the tangential benefits for Africa would be very similar.</p> <p> </p> <p style="margin-left: 160px;">a.    Increasing the participation of women in STEM subjects will have a strong positive GDP impact at EU level. Closing the gender gap in STEM would contribute to an increase in EU GDP per capita by 2.2 to 3.0% in 2050. In monetary terms, closing the STEM gap leads to an improvement in GDP by €610 - €820 billion in 2050.</p> <p style="margin-left: 160px;"> </p> <p style="margin-left: 160px;">b.    Closing gender gaps in STEM education would have a positive impact on employment.  Total EU employment would rise by 850 000 to 1 200 000 by 2050. These jobs are forecasted mostly in the long term as employment rates will rise only after more women studying STEM finish their education.</p> <p><br /> There are many factors impacting education, skills and career development. We need to understand these factors so that inclusivity opportunities can be addressed. If these are not addressed, it will drive further inequality among these workforces.</p> <p><br /> An equal workforce in STEM is vital for many reasons, however it is not a simple problem to solve. If we are committed to evolving our workforce to be more gender-equal, and ensure diversity of thought, we need to take the correct steps towards achieving this.</p> <p><br /> Government, business, and society need to work together in order to make this viable. Starting in homes, parents will need to understand what STEM careers are available to their children and encourage them to get into these fields after school. Companies need to get more involved with educating the community by reskilling and upskilling, and government needs to speed up the roll-out of STEM – in particular technology in schools throughout South Africa.</p> <p><br /> The future workforce can be an equal one but the work must start now to drive these changes, in order for this to become a reality sooner rather than later.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>5 lessons in continuity for distributed technology teams</title>

              <pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DistributedTeams.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Few can argue that 2020 hasn’t been full of worldwide rollercoasters – the biggest being the global COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the accelerated spread of the virus, many organisations have been forced to adapt to a remote working model.<br />  </p> <p>Technology companies have been working with distributed teams for years. For most organisations, this hasn’t been by choice, but rather due to the shortage of skills in the industry. In such a globalised world, building the right technology team with the right skills, experience and chemistry is very unlikely to happen in one location.<br />  </p> <p>At Entelect, we have been <a href="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=59112">running distributed and remote teams</a> for some time now, and so are fortunate enough to not be too disrupted by these unforeseen changes. Below are 5 lessons we’d like to share with others in industry who are perhaps finding themselves in unfamiliar territory:<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lesson 1: Your technological workforce will adapt easily. Be sure to pay attention to non-technical team members who might need support.</strong><br /> Developers, technologists and tinkerers are usually content with working in solitude. They are used to installing and configuring tools, and having their workload managed via a virtual SCRUM board on Jira or Azure DevOps. This means their workflow is the least impacted in a remote delivery environment. On the other hand, analysts, scrum masters, product owners, subject-matter specialists and other less technical roles have a disproportionately harder challenge being as effective as they would have been in a fully co-located working model.<br />  </p> <p>During disruptive times like these, it’s important to establish what degree of frequent communication is required. A well-balanced distributed team should have low-comms roles making an effort to support the high-comms roles, and recognise that this might be a more difficult adjustment for them.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lesson 2: Ensure there’s someone to bridge the gap.</strong><br /> When running a distributed team, there is often a gap between the remote team and the on-site business team. This gap can cause anything from delays in feedback from business to overall patchy communication between the teams. Having somebody “on the inside” is critical for all distributed teams.<br />  </p> <p>Although it’s not always logistically possible, there should ideally be at least one allocated person from the distributed team who is physically based at the business. This person needs to be specifically tasked with helping the remote team by working closely with the business, and acting as a translator and clarification layer between your distributed engineering team and the business. When urgent feedback is required or if there are blockers preventing progress during the project, having an ally to receive mandates or requirements is immeasurably valuable.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lesson 3: Culture is critical.</strong><br /> If you’re completely new to running a remote team, focusing on culture is probably more important now than ever. Switching to distributed model is not an easy transition – especially if it’s done abruptly. Digital tools will go a long way during these transitions, but focusing on team culture will take it a lot further.<br />  </p> <p>Don’t disregard the importance of how people interact to solve problems, socialise and support each other. This might be a good time to relook at your team charter and ensure that the unique attributes that kept your team’s culture alive are still implemented, even when working remotely. Over time, this will result in a culture of delivery regardless of which working model you’re using.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lesson 4: Collaboration is easy, communication is hard.</strong><br /> Teams often have a big push towards collaboration when working remotely. There is no need to start stressing about collaboration. It’s only as difficult as it always was, and only as good as your communication. This is why you need to focus on communication instead. Communication in distributed or remote teams is extremely challenging, and therefore collaboration becomes more difficult.<br />  </p> <p>Good collaboration flows from good communication, and if you spend time and effort on improving comms in your team, you’ll naturally get better at collaborating. The biggest communication challenges in running distributed teams are availability and responsiveness. You need to establish when each team member is available during the day and agree on how frequently everyone responds to requests or enquiries. Lack of availability and responsiveness in teams create bottlenecks that will delay the success of the project.<br />  </p> <p>The challenge here is not the administrative tasks of potentially moving your project backlog to a virtual application or using digital tools to collaborate. It is rather fostering a communication environment that allows for availability and responsiveness to thrive.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lesson 5: Mistakes will be made.</strong><br /> Change is difficult and can often be frustrating. Very rarely will teams pick up a new working model without some hurdles along the way – and that’s okay. Learning to use new communication tools and facing other difficulties like portraying tone and body language correctly will be an adaptation for any team. Have patience with each other and go through these changes as a team.<br />  </p> <p>For many organisations who are currently not using a remote working model by choice but rather due to circumstances, this is the ideal opportunity to see the potential this model has to offer.  When you’re capable and confident in how you operate projects with a distributed workforce, scaling teams becomes substantially easier because you can source and manage them anywhere. There is also value in running the right distributed team versus the wrong co-located team. Don’t view a remote working model as a present complication, but rather as an opportunity to prove your team’s determination when faced with challenges, and prepare your business for new ways of working.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Innovation thrives in a culture of cultures</title>

              <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Innovationthrivesinacultureofcultures.png" /><br />  </p> <p>Innovation as a business concept has many definitions. At its core, the central theme of innovation is the successful delivery of an idea that brings positive value to a company and its customers. However, where there is a large diversity of thought when it comes to the subject, is how to successfully build a “culture of innovation”.<br />  </p> <p>Is it implementing new processes? Is it investing in collaboration technologies and services? Is it ensuring employees have the freedom to fail? Is it setting up innovation labs? Or is it the CEO purely stating the company will now “innovate”?<br />  </p> <p>There is no silver bullet and most of the above can be parts of a greater strategy to foster a culture of innovation. (Side note – leadership is critical but it is an ongoing commitment, not a singular sermon from above.) But like so many things in business, innovation starts with the makeup of the people within a business.<br />  </p> <p>Innovation starts with people coming up with great ideas. The nature, quality and quantity of these ideas can be impacted by multiple factors – the underlying company culture, access to technology and resources, the ever-important factor of time to ideate amongst many others – but always comes back to the source, which is people.<br />  </p> <p>With the starting point being people, what is the best strategy of ensuring that the initial idea factory of business is in the best position to drive a culture and output of innovation? The quantity and quality of ideas are most positively impacted by a diversity of thought and this is achieved through the diversity of your people.<br />  </p> <p>Focusing on evolving the diversity of the people within your business across all the usual factors of demographics, education and experience will organically diversify and strengthen the ideation process. This allows your people to bring their exposure from different cultures that they have experienced throughout their personal and professional lives.<br />  </p> <p>However, that is just one part of it. It is arguably even more important to ensure within any ideation process, session or project to bring in people from multiple disciplines even if their roles and/or expertise don’t naturally fit. A technology-focused ideation project for an app-based development team may not seem like the place for the brand marketing intern to come up with an amazing idea or feature. Through their experience as a frequent app user who spent six months travelling through Europe before starting their role, for example, will give them a far different perspective. This will allow them to provide an insight that a room of app developers would probably never come up with, but those developers than then use their expertise to take the idea and make it the next major feature release.<br />  </p> <p>You can interchange “brand marketing intern” with anyone within a business as ideas don’t come from a qualification but a lifetime of experiences unique to each person. The more diverse those experiences and exposure to varied cultures only widens the scope of thinking within a team.<br />  </p> <p>So when thinking of how to create a culture of innovation that thrives, start with your people, create an environment to foster thinking, give them the time and the tools to create, look at the cultures they have experienced and always expand the diversity of these cultures to foster a successful one unique to your business.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The changing face of skills in technology teams</title>

              <pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 0:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p><br /><br /><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Changingfaceofskills_Banner.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The way we build software is changing. The way we run our processes is changing. The reason is simple: we have to deliver faster. As pressure to compete for customers in the digital world continues to mount, we have been re-arranging our ways of work to embrace the chaos in modern industry, with shortened delivery cycles.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>In order to exploit these broader possibilities, we need diverse skills within our teams – skills that go beyond technical competence and domain knowledge. <a href="https://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=65027" target="_blank">Cross-functional teams housing every discipline</a> (including business), working in smaller units and with a large degree of autonomy, are proving to be the most effective.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Team structures and operating models have to adapt to support these new ways of work. This means that the skills and people in our teams need to adapt towards these needs. Technology teams are not just implementers anymore. Skills previously considered ‘soft’ skills like empathy, critical thinking and curiosity are quickly becoming technical skills core to the craft in all software engineering roles.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>The sheer breadth of possibilities in technology means that it’s just not possible anymore to solve a problem competitively in the market without inviting diversity of ideas, insights and engineering to the processes of product design and requirements specification. Technology teams need to be able to make informed decisions no matter the situation they find themselves in. They are closer to business than ever, they have access to customers, and are making more and more decisions themselves internally.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Individuals who can learn faster but without the requisite tech experience may outperform average or weak team members with perfect tech experience, in a short period of time. We need to consider different competencies in the new skills profile for tech teams.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Skillsprofile-28.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>When recruiting, organising and training your technology teams, there needs to be a renewed understanding of which skills really are critical, and which would be a perk. The new face of technology skills prioritises thinking, engagement and problem solving.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>1. Individuals need to have the ability to solve problems and show a rational thought process. This is determined by seeing whether they can articulate decisions made on their current or previous projects. Presenting ideas and communicating a vision is imperative, as is listening and understanding concepts in a team.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>2. A well-rounded team member needs to understand the fundamentals of their craft (development, analysis, data, UX etc). For team members this means truly understanding core process, tools and pattern from their own perspective (not the textbook). For analysts, this could be requirements elicitation, communication and documentation, and for software engineers it could be languages, data structures and algorithms or design patterns.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>3. Culture-fit is important, many softer skills will make team members much easier to work with. Coachability, approachability and empathy are key ones here. As collaboration extends beyond the traditional IT borers and into business, product, ops and even outside the organisation, these people-oriented skills are now critical to engineering productivity.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>Smaller, self-organising teams and high pace delivery models are becoming the norm because it means better products which are in the market sooner. The type of skills required for these teams is dramatically different to what we needed just 5 years ago. We need to deprioritise focusing solely on industry experience and technical expertise. The skills profile for our technology delivery teams has changed, and we need to rethink how we train, recruit and orient our cultures towards these new skillsets.</p><br /><br /><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>
