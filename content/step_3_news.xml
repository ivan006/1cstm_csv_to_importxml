            <title>Entelect working in military field</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA["The system was technically difficult, we came in aggressively on price and committed to a short time frame, which is why we believe ADS grabbed at the opportunity", says MD Charles Pritchard. Greg Babski, the technical lead on the project put in many overtime hours to assist his team deliver on time. He managed to overcome challenging technical odds and with some smart footwork delivered a workable prototype on the promised 1 April deadline. <br /> This impressive delivery has resulted in dedicated team of Entelect consultants working on a number of strategic long term projects within the company. "We are very happy with the delivery ability and skill level of your engineers", says Pieter Reynecke, ADS Software Development Manager, who spent some time with his team conducting a technical audit of Entelect Software prior to awarding the projects.<br /> <br />]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Retail equity system goes live</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[This system enables the bank to handle large volumes of trade for capital protected products. "It involves the conception of workflows to link the various roles and responsibilities of Front-Office and Operations thereby giving a reliable and fully auditable way to formalise the business in such a way that it can be grown in the future", says Shashi Hansjee, Entelect's lead on the project.<br /> <br /> The live switch over has been exceptionally smooth, without any problems. "The team really did do a great job on this project and the business is really happy with the system", says Penny Futter, Standard Bank's project manager. This is one of the smoothest, trouble free projects she has ever been involved in at the Bank.<br /> <br /> Entelect's bid for this project was a stressful at the time, as the bid was against an established financial services vendor. "We believe we won the project because of our approach, which was hands on with the business from the beginning. We understood the essence of the project on hand, committed to short timelines and our pricing was competitive", says programme manager, Martin Naude, who invested a lot of time with his team on risk to develop a proof of concept prior to being awarded the project.]]></content:encoded>

However, we are finding that Microsoft makes our development life a whole lot easier in a number of arenas, which is in line with our objective of building systems quicker and more cost effectively than our competitors. So we need to be armed with the best tools and partner with the suppliers of relevant technologies".<br /> <br /> Bhavnesh Jairam, one of Entelect's programme managers, has succesfully taken the initiative for the company and gone through the Microsoft ceritification process. "Our next step is to become gold partners - for which we already qualify as a result of systems development and trained professionals in this field" says Jairam.

The challenge now is to "collectively channel these creative minds into generating something that will take us to the next level".<br /> <br /> Entelect Software's Managing Director Martin Naude has been putting together training (mentorship) programmes for new staff, technology forums, and more recently product innovation forums to drive internal Research and Development. The challenge is to "organically reach our goals - which are big - and at the same time have fun getting there", says Pritchard and Naude. Some ideas that are being thrown around are in the mobile and internet arenas, with one of the objectives being to "quickly and easily enable smaller businesses from an applications and IT perspective without the prohibitive costs involved.... Of course creating a product with mass appeal, would be the jackpot!" ]]></content:encoded>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Club's official sponsor is MTN, while Entelect will be a sub-sponsor together with SAP. "Despite minimal marketing exposure since inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the last few of years - primarily on a word of mouth basis. In order to maintain our growth targets, we have now reached a phase of our business where brand awareness is becoming important", says group CEO Charles Pritchard. Club 100 boasts a large membership base, which gives Entelect excellent brand exposure on cycling shirts and the club website. "We particularly like the concept of a moving billboard".<br /> <br /> The sponsorship deal includes brand exposure on members' cycling shirts and the club website, which is currently being rebuilt by Entelect. ]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect Software awarded Microsoft Gold Partner status</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ryan Naude, Entelect's Microsoft channel champion, says: "In the near future, we will be obtaining Gold status in other areas too; we're just going through the final hurdles. We've successfully completed several projects using Microsoft technology, which provides us with the flexibility and functionality to achieve true rapid development. We're looking forward to using these technologies in the future."<br /> <br /> Besides delivering .NET solutions, Entelect has a strong pool of Java resources delivering solutions to the likes of Discovery and Standard Bank. One of the longer term objectives is to achieve a similar certified status in the Java sphere.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect Software has acquired that illustrious Microsoft Gold Partner status. "Although we had the qualifications prior, we felt that formal certification is essential in establishing ourselves as a serious software design and development company," says group CEO Charles Pritchard. "Microsoft offers a value-added marketing channel to its partners and we hope to work closer with them in delivering software solutions across all business areas."]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect active launched: sports management systems</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[This project was initiated with one of South Africa's biggest Cycling Clubs, Club100 and established Event Organisers, Harford Sports Promotions and Tanjent Events, who run events like the Pick n Pay 94.7 Cycle Challenge (2nd biggest timed cycle event in the world) as well as the 702 Walk the Talk (biggest sport event in South Africa attracting 55 000 competitors). Entelect Software has taken over the support contracts of both these online systems, and from experiences gained here has already started injecting its new product suite into events like the Zoo Lake Criterium and the Citizen Run. "The benefits of this new software are significant", says Tanjent Evets partner, Jenni Green: "I can now manage the entire event with Entelect's software without unnecessary third party delays delays and IT support expense".<br /> <br /> Entelect has appointed Craig Wapnick, ex professional squash player and Springbok Captain to drive sales efforts. "This software is phenomenal in terms of its functionality, power and cost, and will fill a gaping hole in the sporting arena", says Wapnick.<br /> <br /> "When confronted with the problem, our team took on the challenge and (in true Entelect fashion) instead of building an instance of a solution for Club100 and HSP, they took it one step further and built the tools to provide them with a solution. Yes it was a more costly exercise, but now it is simply plug and play going forward, allowing for a scalable low cost solution for all participants", says Pritchard.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect has launched a powerful new suite of sports management online products, aimed at giving sporting bodies (national, provincial, clubs and event organisers) the tools to enhance their business processes and run their own affairs. The offering is currently broken into Event and Club Management Systems. "This software is unique in that it gives total control to non technical people to set up their online presence and control all aspects of their workflow through the web - including member or entrant management and CRM, database management, online payments, website content management, customised newsletters and SMS's, and a variety of other front and back-office functions facilities", says group CEO Charles Pritchard. "We empower event organisers and sports administrators with powerful self-managing software to run their own affairs - and cut out the expense of bespoke development and support. We have taken a suite of common functions performed by these entities and built our software to support these industries, with a low cost rental and sponsorship model that enables organisations to make use of software that they otherwise could not afford."]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect achieves in 2009 despite the ecomomic downturn</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect Software's consulting and projects divisions succesfully completed all 36 projects on time and within budget! At any one time we had approximately 25 concurrent projects running. A big thank you to our development teams for their exceptional performance! We can confidently say that every single one of our software engineers are above average performers. The attached unsolicited reference from the CIO of Discovery Health for the succesful rewrite of the Discovery Health Vitality system sums up the achievement of this team and in fact all of our teams. Design processes, knowledge sharing and training were streamlined. This division is still the cornerstone of our business and will continue to be for some time. We are working on some interesting large-scale proposals and have a strong sales pipeline for 2010.<br /> <br /> In the software products division we signed on 43 new clients and are gearing for rapid growth this year. We can say with confidence that Entelect Web Manager, Event Manager and Recruitment Manager are best of breed and with our ongoing investments will continue to set themselves apart from competitors, locally and globally. A sizable investment in hosting infrastructure was also made, ensuring that our clients can securely run their business systems on our servers and online products.<br /> <br /> Entelect Placements made 62 placements at 27 clients despite its small staff complement! This is a remarkable achievement considering the tight market conditions. Working in a scarce skills market is challenging and difficult, but when the cards are down, quality comes to the fore and is in demand. We have stayed focused on recruiting high-end IT and supply chain skills, which has served us well.<br /> <br /> Entelect Cape Town relocated from Cape Town to Stellenbosch. The primary reason for this was that our newly appointed Managing Director of this office, Wally Fernandes, is based there. We wish Wally all the best in this new project and look forward to working with him.]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Despite the economic downturn in 2009, the Entelect group experienced strong financial performance for financial year ending March 2010. The primary reason for this is that we slowed down recruitment and focused on optimising the software projects, consulting and resourcing businesses. Operationally we also made great strides with our infrastructure, billing, administration and finance divisions. A substantial investment was made in the software products division, which is now performing well and the foundations are there for rapid growth.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect gears for growth in 2011</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect’s rebranding exercise was a success. By June this year we will be launching a new web presence on our Web and Recruitment Manager product suites. In particular, we are pleased to announce the formalisation of our business-to-business branded entities, focusing on the full supply chain of software engineering delivery, namely:<br /> <ul> <li> Entelect Software: Focusing on custom software development solutions to business</li> <li> Entelect Online: Delivery of online software products to business</li> <li> Entelect Placements: Catering for the recruitment and resourcing aspects of our clients</li> <li> Entelect Training: Training software engineering professionals</li> </ul> Entelect Software, which makes up about 85% of our turnover continues to be the cornerstone of our business. We had a difficult 2010 as a result of a couple of sizable project delays beyond our control, but closed off the year well with the start of a few big projects, in particular Liberty BurnjOules – an online loyalty programme for Liberty Health. This is a full software outsource to Entelect and with version 1 launch now complete, we understand it is the single biggest implementation of Microsoft Azure in Africa – which puts Entelect at the forefront of cloud computing worldwide.<br /> <br /> Our three biggest Software clients for 2010 were Discovery (Health, Invest and Life), Standard Bank CIB (who have been with us for many years), and Liberty (Health and Life). We ran custom development projects for about 25 active clients at any one time, with a healthy spread of JAVA and .NET projects. Besides servicing the South African market, one of our strategic intents is to deliver outsourced software solutions to international clients. In this respect we welcome on board Hollard in Australia as a client, who we have no doubt we will have a long and mutually beneficial relationship with.<br /> <br /> Entelect Online, which is now in its second year of operation, grew from 50 to 150 client installations in 2010. Although this business currently only constitutes about 5% of our turnover, it is showing great long term growth potential, following the international trend towards the “software as a service” model. We do believe that we have some unique value propositions, so look forward to delivering on these. This business is maturing with the appointment of our first four Resellers who include Entelect ERP (a Sage reseller), Cyclenation (Australia), Advendurance and Baobab International.  <br /> <br /> Entelect Placements continues to deliver solid results with a comfortable 5% of turnover despite a small team. We expect steady growth for 2011 and will focus on the delivery of quality professional people to our clients.<br /> <br /> Entelect Training, which is in its infancy, will be taking a grassroots approach by launching a distance learning solution for school children in the next couple of months. The focus will be on laying the foundations with maths and over time will lead into tertiary level training for software engineers. Of course, we will continue to provide customised training courses for our Software clients and partners.<br /> <br /> Our investment in research and development will be significant this year, and we look forward to delivering innovative software solutions to large, medium and small enterprises, both locally and abroad, so expect a few exciting announcements down the line.<br /> <br /> We wish all our clients and partners a profitable and healthy year ahead!]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Last year was the year of change at Entelect, in particular to accommodate our growth and maturity as a business. We welcome on board our new team of general managers as well as the appointment of Martin Naude to Entelect’s Chief Technology Officer and Shashi Hansjee to Entelect Software’s Managing Director. We are already seeing the benefits of this restructure with an order book that we are battling to keep up with. As before, we are not compromising on quality when it comes to hiring, so will only grow as fast as we can find quality people. Our ethos of providing high quality people and software solutions at competitive pricing continues to deliver results.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect pioneers Azure Cloud implementation for Liberty</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory"><br /> </font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">The company chose Azure because it allows them to build, host and scale software applications in secure Microsoft data centres.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">“Hosting on Microsoft Azure was the reason we could provide Liberty with delivery in the timeframes they required. It also simplified and enhanced the quality of the overall solution. Certainly there were challenges, but for a system architected from scratch, requiring such a complex distribution of partners, the cloud proved to be the best solution, without a doubt,” said Martin Naude, Chief Technology Officer at Entelect Software.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">The project started in July 2010 with an in-depth consulting and specifications stage. A key requirement was finding a central location for the project's diverse stakeholders and the business requirement to be able to roll out the programme internationally, and facilitate an unlimited number of partners, members and brokers in the future.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">Entelect had to overcome a variety of serious challenges in the development of the burn jOules product, but it was well worth the effort for the benefits involved.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">The cloud platform, while it requires a learning curve in development, provides a range of services that simplifies and enhances the system. The provision of services such as queuing, reporting, integration and optimisation, are cost effective and efficient through economies of scale. Another advantage is how Windows Azure takes care of countless software versions and backward compatibility issues. While there are always risks no matter what you do, the platform offers the best minds on a large scale to secure your company and stakeholder information.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">Entelect Software has planned and tested the product extensively before going live. The company's careful attention to detail upfront has allowed them to produce a superb product, which meets all the client requirements.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">Entelect is using the cloud platform for a number of other projects, and the experience they gained through their innovative use of the Azure platform is helping them to cement their position as pioneers in the field.</font></font></p> <p> <font size="2"><font class="PressReleaseStory">Other Azure projects currently in development by Entelect Software include a digital store, a labour management portal for specialists in engineering, a dynamic system for managing inventory and high-value equipment across multiple sites, a bird watching information platform, and Entelect's Web, event and retail management online product suites. With projects such as these currently being developed, the company is rapidly expanding its knowledge base and market exposure.</font></font></p> <p> <font class="PressReleaseEditorNote"><strong style="">Entelect</strong></font></p> <p> <font class="PressReleaseEditorNote">Entelect is a leading software engineering and solutions company with head offices in Johannesburg, South Africa. Our rapid growth and respected reputation is driven by our strong delivery track record, exceptional people and approach to solving business problems.</font></p> <p> <font class="PressReleaseEditorNote">Since inception in 2001, Entelect has established itself as a quality player with a strong client base spanning most industry sectors, some of which include financial services, healthcare, entertainment, telecommunications, engineering, mining and logistics.</font></p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[After less than a year of development, Entelect Software is preparing for the upcoming launch of the new Liberty Health burn jOules Customer Loyalty Programme. The development and rollout of this programme is a significant step forward for the use of cloud computing in South Africa. Entelect Software used the Microsoft Azure platform for the entire system, including self-service portals for members, partners, intermediaries and administrators.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect Foundation committed to maths education</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Access to maths education, from an early age and throughout a child’s school career, can lay the foundations for many important life skills. Adults who have a good understanding of maths are more competent with their personal finances. Mathematics teaches people to think analytically, to be good problem solvers; they can look at a problem from many different angles and will stick to it until it is finished instead of giving up before they have solved it. A child who does well at basic and complex maths will be able to apply these concepts to everyday life.<br /> <br /> Literacy and scientific resources will also be provided to school and tertiary level students and communities who would otherwise not be able to afford these. The Foundation is also developing options for corporates who wish to invest in the development of their extended communities.<br /> <br /> Entelect has partnered with New Age Electronic Entertainment Technologies cc (NAEET) to provide robust projectors to 3 schools as a proof of concept. These “Teacher in a Box” projectors will be easy to use, remotely controlled, and loaded with high-quality, curriculum-specific educational content.<br /> <br /> The Entelect Foundation’s inaugural meeting was held on 8 September 2011 where invited committee members were ratified and the path set for formal registration as a not for profit institution. The Foundation will work with business and government to build a self-sustaining, scalable blueprint that works in a South African context. <br />]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Less than two months after it was founded in September 2011, the Entelect Foundation is making great strides in its mission to empower South African youth through education. The Foundation will be providing educational resources to community centres, schools and homes.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Exciting times ahead for the Entelect R100k Challenge</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[“There has been little investment in the SA development community. We wanted to turn that around with this competition and inject a some fun back into the industry. Game development is still the holy grail for a lot of our guys and we thought that this challenge would generate some excitement. Perhaps bring the community together in a different way. Judging by the success so far, I believe we can turn this into an annual event and keep upping the stakes!” says Charles Pritchard, Entelect's CEO.  <br /><br />The Entelect R100K Challenge is for anyone who has a keen interest in software development. Those with a background in Artificial Intelligence may have an advantage in this competition, however there is an abundance of information online about the strategies and mechanics applicable to these types of turn-based games. A little extra effort and foresight will go a long way in seeing that the ultimate AI player makes it through to the finals!   <br /><br />The tournament play-offs will be hosted on the 28th of September to a closed audience of entrants. These initial rounds will see players paired off in a double-elimination style tournament with only the superior AI players progressing to later rounds. To add to the excitement, the final rounds will be hosted LIVE on the main stage at rAge expo on the 6th of October in-front of 20 000 attendees. The event will also be broadcast live on the internet for all to see thanks to NAG Online.   With a closing date of 24th September there is still plenty of time to get your engines started. <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za/">Accept the challenge today</a>!]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[It’s been a little less than two weeks since the announcement of the Entelect R100K Challenge and already we’ve been overwhelmed by the response. With over 200 entrants and thousands of eyes on the competition, the stage has been set for a nail-biting tournament which sees the country’s brightest minds go neck-a-neck in an epic AI battle for the grand prize of R100 000 and the title of AI Champion!]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect makes high volume, secure EFT online payments possible for business</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[“The initial demand for this solution came from a number of clients that make use of our online event, retail and subscription management products”, says Charles Pritchard, Entelect’s CEO. “The reality in South Africa is that the bulk of our citizens are not credit card enabled or even banked, but would like to transact online. We have put hundreds of companies online and an ability to accept high volume EFT or cash deposit micro payments is a common request that has filtered through from our clients – in particular big sports event organisers and online retailers who process thousands of applications a day in high volume periods. Until now they have had to manually reconcile and follow up the EFT portions of their payments, which come at a significant administration cost”. <br /><br />This solution now takes ownership of the whole collection and reconciliation process in an automated fashion for a lower fee than credit card merchants are able to offer. “We use intelligent matching algorithms that strongly couple our online applications to bank account statements. What really sets our solution apart from similar ones in the market is that the online purchaser does not need to divulge his bank account details or PIN codes, thus leaving a high level of comfort with the both the purchaser and merchant. Credit charge-back fraud is no longer an issue.” says Pritchard. <br /><br />Entelect is able to offer this EFT solution coupled with credit card merchant facilities through its <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/DisplayLink.aspx?group=Software&name=Products">online products</a> together with <a href="http://www.myactive.co.za/">MyActive</a> or as part of a <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/DisplayLink.aspx?group=Software&name=Development">specialised custom application</a> that it builds for its clients. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/contact.aspx">Contact us</a> for more information!]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect Software, South Africa’s leading software solutions and consulting company, has released an innovative EFT reconciliation module which uses a combination of artificial intelligence and traditional banking technology for use in e-commerce applications, opening the doors for the majority of South Africans to transact securely online.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect Foundation goes back to basics</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> "We toyed with so many possibilities and even had advanced teaching aides built as prototypes. Although these initiatives can have an effect, after much discussion and planning, we decided that pushing technology onto schools involves too much red tape and slows down our ability to make an impact. We have a budget and we want to spend it wisely” says Dr Charles Pritchard, Entelect founder and CEO. “After all, Entelect’s Engineers are all extremely privileged, possessing high quality degrees at leading universities. We are actually the best qualified to offer this support to children in need, so who better to start with than our extended staff communities. What people need first is hands on mentorship and support, with some basic financial assistance – fancy technology can follow after basic needs are met.” <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/DisplayCustomLink.aspx?name=SocialInvestment">Click here</a> for more information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Almost a year into the launch of the Entelect Foundation, and after much investigation into potential high impact “tech” projects at schools, Entelect has gone back to basics and is initiating a simple empowerment programme for South Africa’s underprivileged children. The beneficiaries will be underprivileged children of extended community members of our staff, i.e., children who they know of who need schooling support. The programme involves paying for school fees, ancillary support, tutoring and mentorship assistance with homework on Saturday mornings.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Jaco Cronje banks R100k courtesy of the Entelect R100K Challenge!</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> The atmosphere at rAge was electric with a packed to capacity audience and an excited group of finalists. The event started with attendees and finalists taking their seats against the backdrop of Daft Punk’s Tron soundtrack. The excitement was palpable as members of the audience compared notes and bets on who would be the victor. Minutes later Tim Kroon (Entelect Software) took the stage to talk about the R100K challenge and its place in the software development industry. Highlighting a need for a larger community in South Africa and a bit of fun, he mentioned to a very pleased audience that Entelect would be bringing back the Entelect R100K Challenge in 2013 with a different twist. <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter the battles begun. The games were shown on the big screen with a 3D spinning globe as the players rode their light cycles around in a number of different and intriguing strategies. The tournament finals were particularly nail-biting as each match was a face-off between two highly intelligent light cycle programs. The results were surprising and at the end of the double-elimination tournament, we saw the victor of the losing pool, Jaco Cronje (JC), being crowned as tournament champion. Second place went to Gustav Mauer (Gustav) and third place went to Marcus Tomlinson (Mr T). <br /> <br /> The finalists were invited on stage and each presented with medals while the champion received a large R100 000 cheque! Second prize was an uber cool limited edition, Star Wars X-Box 360 game bundle.<br /> <br /> “This was a first for us and judging from the spirited response we plan to up the stakes each year, so keep an eye out for our 2013 Challenge announcement! Contestants worked hard on their entries and engaged with us from the start, which tells us something about the calibre of individuals that we have in the South African software engineering industry. We’d like to extend a big thank you to NAG Magazine for partnering with us and assisting us to reach out with this initiative. ” – Charles Pritchard, Entelect CEO. <br /> <br /> For those of you interested in staying tuned for the 2013 Entelect Challenge, subscribe to the mailing list at <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za" target="_blank">http://challenge.entelect.co.za</a>!</p> <p>  <img alt="" height="323" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-90858-cmsimages/100kprize550.jpg" width="550" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect announces 60% growth at year-end bash</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> In his year-end speech CEO Charles Pritchard pointed out that the main strategic theme this year was to focus efforts internally, nurture talent and make Entelect a better place to work. In summary, the following achievements were noted:</p> <p> <strong>Revenues where up by 45% in 2012</strong>: With over 100 successful projects delivered, most of Entelect’s new business was as a result of referrals and demands of existing clients. Biggest growth clients were Discovery, Momentum, Liberty and Paarlmedia; while Nashua Mobile, Deloitte and FNB joined as three new anchor clients.</p> <p> <strong>Staff count grew by 60%</strong>: We can still say with certainty that we are still by far the most educated software company in SA, enjoying more university degrees and cum laudes per head than any of our competitors.</p> <p> <strong>600% more spend on career development of staff</strong>: We ran 14 independent staff training programmes, which includes multiple leadership programmes, forums, code retreats and DevDays.</p> <p> <strong>The Entelect Foundation committed to seeing 42 disadvantaged children through school</strong>: These children were put forward by our extended communities and we are looking forward to providing financial and mentorship support to these children and their parents in the upcoming year!</p> <p> <strong>1Up</strong>, our own in-house staff rewards programme was launched in the middle of the year with great success.</p> <p> <strong>The Entelect R100k “think you can code” Challenge</strong> went off successfully, gaining significant media exposure and goodwill in the developer community.</p> <p> Entelect has ambitious plans for 2013, in particular solidifying its position as South Africa’s best software engineering and solutions company, both from a client and staff satisfaction perspective. Expect a number of exciting new announcements in 2013.<br />  </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect’s annual year-end party took place at Riverstone Lodge on Friday 23 November in Muldersdrift. A variety of team-based “Entelect Survivor Games” activities took place in the afternoon, followed by drinks and prize-giving on the terrace and a superb dinner buffet of South African foods. Dancing and festivities progressed at full vigour with the last bus departing in the early hours of the morning!]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect Foundation supporting 45 underprivileged children</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> From a mentorship perspective, children are broken into small themed groups according to age, including a class for adults, with a few Entelect volunteers leading each programme. Themes are broad and cover topics such as mathematics, languages, digital citizenship, career planning, entrepreneurship, IT literacy and financial management. The idea is to make the sessions as interactive, fun and personalised as possible.</p> <p> "I think as professionals we forget the amount of knowledge and experience we have accumulated, and often take it for granted that everyone has the same support structures as we do. Simply pointing someone in the right direction, giving advice or helping an individual overcome a personal obstacle, however small it may seem, can have a significant impact on one's life down the line. Not only do the children and guardians come out of small group sessions feeling inspired, but so do the tutors - it's a win-win for everyone!" says Charles Pritchard, Entelect CEO.</p> <p> If anyone would like us to share experiences and provide guidance on running a similar programme, please <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/contact.aspx">contact us</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect, through its Foundation programme, is mentoring and financially supporting 45 underprivileged school children this year. Beneficiaries' names were put forward by staff members who know them, thus forming part of the company's extended community. Entelect's commitment is to pay for school fees, books, uniforms and other related education activities until they graduate, taking on new recipients each year as the company grows. Coupled with this a team of 25 Entelect volunteers (and friends) are assisting the children and their parents or guardians on weekends with mentorship support.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect R100k finalists named</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> Saturday night’s play-offs saw the <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za/">2013 Entelect R100k</a> contestants go head to head in an epic (and sometimes not-so-epic, but hilarious) battle at the Fire and Ice Hotel in Melrose Arch. The evening started with introductions and a guest interview with a developer from Naughty Dog Studios (creators of The Last of Us, Uncharted) and rolled on into the battles which saw the contestant pool narrowed down to the final 8 who will be battling it out live at rAge expo on the 5th of October at 11am.  Each contestant had to create a smart, artificially intelligent player in a game based on the Nintendo classic ‘Battle City’. The player had control of two tanks that battled it out for superiority on the battle field against the opposing team, with the objective being to wipe out the opponents base and players. The contestants played out on a variety of terrains, including a replica of the original battle city stage 1. </div> <div>  </div> <div> The Entelect R100K challenge this year marked a departure technically from last year’s turn-based approach, offering a real-time game in which opponents issued commands to their tanks using web-service technology. The team-based approach added an additional dimension to player strategy by allowing them control of two players as opposed to last year’s Tron challenge which gave the contestants control of a single player. In addition to the multiplayer approach, random terrain maps for each game meant that strategies had to be smarter and adaptive to their environments. </div> <div>  </div> <div> After an exciting battle, New Age Gaming magazine and rAge were good enough to hand out some freebies including annual subscriptions to NAG and double tickets to rAge expo. We are happy to announce that the following contenders will be going through to the finals and will stand a chance to win the grand prize of R100 000 at rAge! </div> <div>  </div> <div> G-J van Rooyen (scalvin)</div> <div> Jan Gutter (The Dalek)</div> <div> Jaco Cronje (JC)</div> <div> Hendrik Coetzee (demaniak)</div> <div> Werner Stoop (Wernsey)</div> <div> Marius Potgieter (Monkey)</div> <div> Pierre Pretorius (Pierre)</div> <div> Lucas Dreyer (Lucas)<br /> <br /> For more information visit the <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za/">Challenge Page</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[In this iteration of Entelect’s annual R100 000 AI challenge, players competed in a nostalgic battle of the 8-bit classic, Battle City. Each player controlled a team of two tanks, with the objective of defending their own base while destroying their enemies. A range of maps added variety to the mix while the grand prize gave motivation – R100 000 to be awarded to the player who is victorious at the finals to be held at the largest gaming expo in South Africa, the rAge expo.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect BootCamp graduates are in big demand in South Africa</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> ‘Every year we handpick and hire about 20 of the top BSc Computer Science, Engineering and BCom Information Systems graduates from all mainstream universities around the country for the Graduate BootCamp. The graduates attend intensive training for two months while on full salaries. After this, they work on client projects free of charge for three months under the mentorship of our team leads. At the end of this period, clients are given the opportunity to retain them on our projects at our standard junior rates,’ says Entelect MD, Shashi Hansjee.<br />  </div> <div> Entelect CEO, Dr Charles Pritchard ‘Our clients benefit as they get to work with the country’s top graduates on a risk-free basis for an initial period before they commit. Our graduates escalate their technical careers, while our seniors also benefit personally from from helping junior colleagues in the specialist areas that they are most passionate about.’<br />  </div> <div> The BootCamp course covers both the practical and theoretical side of business analysis, programming concepts, Microsoft.NET, Java Enterprise Edition and SQL development. All graduates work through this full syllabus, regardless of which solutions stream they will be working on, giving them a rounded understanding of the full software development life cycle. ‘By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they will have collaborated to write components of systems in various languages and platforms, all of which would have been vetted and code-reviewed by various technical leads,’ says Hansjee. <br />  </div> <div> ‘Of course there is a downside risk. It takes us about a year to recover our investment in each graduate, so if the graduate leaves early, we lose financially. That said, it’s a risk with which we are comfortable as we go to great lengths to live up to our goal of being the best company in South Africa to work for. Despite the high demand for engineers, we manage to maintain high staff retention rates – not an easy task considering the dynamics of the industry,’ says Pritchard. <br />  </div> <div> Entelect’s client base is amongst the best blue-chips in South Africa. Their appetite for the development of big custom systems that differentiate them in the marketplace keeps climbing, hence the demand for software engineers. The culture of ongoing training and mentorship that spans more than 15 career-enhancement programmes, is a real differentiator for Entelect employees. These range from leadership programmes to technology accelerators and specialist technical forums. </div> <div>  </div> <div> Asked about the current state of skills in South Africa, Pritchard says, ‘There is a severe shortage of high-end software engineering skills in this country. Our problem is not the pursuit of new projects as word gets out that we consistently do a great job but instead, one of finding quality engineers to help us deliver on our order pipeline. If we could hire 30 people today, we would take them! Technology is becoming such an integral part of everyone’s lives, and businesses simply cannot run without an innovation focus in this industry. We believe investing more in quality software engineering training programmes as a national priority, and if we don’t embrace it as an industry and government collective, we as a nation will lose out on the significant employment opportunities available in the IT sector. South Africa has this massive potential just waiting to be unleashed!’</div>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect is leading the way in fast-tracking graduate computer scientists, software engineers and analysts into the South African market place. Considering that these are some of the most in-demand skills in the world, it’s a big investment that comes with the associated business and financial risks but is paying off in the long run.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Coders and gamers get ready for the annual Entelect R100K challenge</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"> The Challenge is co-hosted by Entelect Software and NAG Magazine, South Africa’s authority on current trends in computer, console, online and mobile gaming and technology-related entertainment. “We are extremely excited to be a part of the Entelect 100K Challenge for yet another exciting year! This is no doubt a great career starter for those who have what it takes to be the ultimate coder,” says Geoff Burrows, editor of NAG magazine.<br />  </p> <p class="MsoNormal"> The Challenge is open to all coders and gamers who think they have what it takes to build the ultimate artificially intelligent player. Participants are required to write an innovative artificially intelligent program worthy of playing against any opponent in a game designed specifically for the Entelect R100K Challenge. </p> <p class="MsoNormal"> <br /> “This year’s competition sees entrants compete in the classic game of Pacman, with a twist. Entrants will be divided into two separate pools based on their abilities, with each pool yielding grand-prize winners of the 2014 Challenge. This effectively allows beginner programmers and AI enthusiasts to compete against each other, with a better chance of making it into the final four than previous years, with the winner taking home a cash prize of R50,000. Similarly, the more advanced entrants will pair off against each other in the advanced pool for the grand prize of R100,000,” says Tim Kroon, general manager at Entelect Solutions.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"> <br /> Pool A will contain the more advanced entries in the challenge and Pool B will feature the remainder. Each pool will be run as a separate, double-elimination tournament, with individual prizes. Entelect will determine the appropriate pool and rank for each entrant based on the ability of the entry and by playing each entry against a set of reference players.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"> <br /> This year, Entelect will be opening up the opportunity for programmers and designers to build their own Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the game and will be presenting the special Gooey (GUI) award for the Best GUI at rAge (Really Awesome Gaming Expo) in October 2014. This is the first award of this nature in the R100K Challenge — the winner will be taking home a R15,000 cash prize and will be featured at the challenge play-offs press event.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"> <br /> Successful entrants into the challenge will take part in a tournament with scheduled play-offs held on 13 September 2014 at the Fire & Ice Hotel in Melrose Arch. The entrants will compete against each other in an online environment and fight for a place in the grand finale on 4 October 2014 at rAge.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"> <br /> “It was a great achievement to be named the winner of last year’s challenge. The competition was demanding but extremely exciting. I wish all the entrants the best of luck for this year’s challenge and may the best coder win,” says Pierre Pretorius, winner of the 2013 Entelect R100k Challenge.</p> <div> <br /> Entries for the Entelect 100K Challenge will close on 16 August 2014 and entrants will be notified of their pools by 1 September. To enter the competition, please visit <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za/" target="_blank">http://challenge.entelect.co.za</a>. For further information please contact the official challenge mailing list on <a href="mailto:challenge@entelect.co.za">challenge@entelect.co.za</a>.</div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect attains CPD validation</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[This validation is good news for those seeking to renew their Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA) membership and comply with the Council's CPD requirements. The CPD requirements were put in place by ECSA in 2006 to ensure that those who practise as engineers, stay abreast of developments and advancements within their profession and are continuously maintaining and developing their knowledge within the field of practice. <br /> <br /> A further requirement from ECSA is that organisations are encouraged to present CPD activities, as well as to assist their members in identifying CPD activities initiated by private providers. To this end, Entelect ensures that its training sessions are of a high standard and it is especially good to see that the company’s internal forums are given value by independent organisations. <br /> <br /> The accreditation means that professionals can now grow their CPD level by attending in-house training. Gail Shaw, technical lead (SQL Server) at Entelect presents the course to all Entelect employees free of charge. Shaw is well regarded in the industry and is a Microsoft Certified Master: SQL Server. This particular validation is only the beginning as Entelect is in the process of accrediting a number of other forums.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect confirmed as the world's best loyalty practitioners</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[LoyaltyGames is a global, online competition that was created for students and professionals to put their loyalty and gamification skills to the test, while fostering innovation and positive knowledge sharing.<br /> <br /> The early rounds of this year’s LoyaltyGames were held simultaneously across the globe, with a variety of time limitations and detailed deliverables required. Contestants were challenged with a series of multiple-choice questions and case-study analyses, which were designed to test their understanding of loyalty marketing, enterprise strategy and innovation in the fields of customer analytics and gamification techniques. <br /> <br /> Naude, who comes from a background specialising in loyalty rewards and computer science, was selected from more than 1,500 candidates from around the world to create his final submission as one of the World Top 12 Finalists. The competition was fierce but Naude impressed the judges with his ‘Pin’ concept presentation and was crowned world champion, with Krzysztof Przybylski of Poland and Daria Demina from Russia as runners-up. <br /> <br /> Naude explains that taking part in the LoyaltyGames has solidified his belief in the importance of innovation in ever-evolving industries, such as gamification, loyalty marketing and consumer engagement. ‘Not only is it incredibly exciting to make it through to the finals and to actually win, but the value of the experience in building on expertise cannot be underestimated,’ says Naude, ‘I feel honoured to have competed against such remarkable industry minds, and I’d certainly encourage others to take part in the LoyaltyGames to challenge their own skills and push themselves to create exciting new ideas.’ <br /> <br /> Naude currently heads up Entelect’s Encentivize business, a world leading platform offering that enables companies to implement turnkey staff, customer or agent loyalty solutions.

            <title>2014 SQLBits</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The keynote was on the architecture and infrastructure of SQL Azure… or whatever it’s named this week. The architecture is fascinating, as is their attitude to failure. They use commodity hardware, not server-grade hardware. This naturally makes failures more common. They expect failure and they actually plan for it.<br /> <br /> It’s a very different design from most on-premises data centres, where a failure is a major problem. With the Azure data centres, a hardware failure may be left unattended to for up to two weeks. The architecture is built around the concept of ‘self-healing’. Servers that fail are simply left until the next scheduled maintenance. Any databases that are affected by the failed server have a new replica built, completely transparently. There’s a complex quorum mechanism to ensure that only up-to-date replicas are used. Writes are done to all replicas and reads can be done from any synchronised replica.<br /> <br /> After the keynote (and fresh coffee), Denny Cherry dived into SQL Server’s Availability Groups, detailing the features, limitations and improvements in SQL 2014. He also covered a few case studies, implementations of both the SQL 2012 version and the SQL 2014 version. A complete start-to-finish demo of setting up an Availability Group finished that session.<br /> <br /> After Denny’s session, it was final checks and rehearsal for my first session.This session on database corruption was to a fairly small audience. Lots and lots of questions though – I ended up skipping the last couple of slides because of all the questions!<br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/gayle_bits_pic.jpg" width="100%" /><br /> <br /> Which reminds me, I still need to check whether the statement in Books Online, which states that checksum is always enabled for compressed backups, is actually correct… I have a vague recollection that either the statement is incorrect or there are some other caveats. By the time I finished with all the questions and discussions afterwards, the last session of the day was well underway and both sessions I wanted to go to were full – thankfully, there are always the recordings! Instead, I ended up spending the rest of the afternoon chatting with Brent Ozar and a few other MVPs in the coffee area, so it wasn't all bad.<br /> <br /> Friday evening was the SQLBits party. The steampunk theme was appropriate for a conference venue, which is near to where the industrial revolution began. Long coats, hats and goggles were in abundance. While some made just a token attempt at a costume, some came decked out to the nines.<br /> <br /> Saturday started with a session on T-SQL tricks by Itzik Ben-Gan. Itzik is always full of fun new techniques and this session was no exception. All of the tips were around the Windowing functions (Row_Number, Rank, etc.) along with their SQL 2012 enhancements, LEAD, LAG and the window bounds definitions. Half of the tips he showed us were ways of handling complicated ‘gaps and islands’ type problems, where a data set has a sequential series of numbers with gaps, and the rows need to be ‘grouped’ into sets delimited by the gaps in the sequence. This used to be a very difficult problem before the introduction of the windowing functions but now it’s fairly trivial.<br /> <br /> After Itzik’s session, it was time for final prep (and more coffee) for my session on problematic execution plans. I thought this session went very well, better than the corruption one – the room was packed. There weren’t too many questions, which was good as there was a lot of material to get through. That said, there were quite a few questions after the session, so I missed Steve Jones’ session, which I’d hoped to attend… more recordings to get!<br /> <br /> After lunch, it was time to sit in Brent Ozar’s session on hardware choices for SQL Server. He made some very valid points about SANs no longer being the only option for high-end SQL Server machines, something that should be kept in mind when planning new servers. SANs are expensive and, if not configured properly for SQL Server, can become a serious bottleneck. With the price of enterprise-grade SSDs dropping and the improvements in SMB 3, internal storage or a NAS built with SSDs may be comparable in price with a SAN but they perform much better. Staying to chat with Brett about hardware and his experiences with large corporates meant I missed the last session. Still, the sessions are all recorded and the chat with Brett was really valuable. By the end of the day, the strain was getting to some… It didn’t help that the demand on the coffee machines had resulted in three out of the four breaking down. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a very well-run, well-organised conference, with interesting sessions and good presenters. Because all the sessions were recorded (video camera and desktop capture) it meant there wasn’t massive pressure to attend a session if there was an opportunity instead to chat directly with any of the (many) MVPs and MCMs who were there.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>DevDayII feedback</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="" height="208" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Team.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 10px 20px 20px 0;" width="300" />Primarily, DevDay is a platform for staff collaboration and the promotion of unique ideas. The day focuses on employees’ pet projects and any projects they are interested in in their spare time. There are also demonstrations of new and exciting frameworks, discussions around the technologies used on projects as well as the process around development or operations. <br /> <br /> For the first time, DevDay was extended to include presentation stands and specialist speakers on a wide range of topics. The day was incredibly beneficial to all who attended – below is some feedback from attendees and speakers.<br /> <br /> <strong><br /> Name: Rushil O’Jageer</strong> <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Software Engineer <br /> I am always excited to attend the Entelect DevDays. DevDays give me the opportunity to learn about all the innovative stuff I’m not exposed to on a daily basis, giving me a foundation from which I can work and explore further. The fact that we get 1-UP points for attending also helps. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D Program Rishal presented and the cool technologies you can use to create CMS, presented by Matt. Rishal stood out as the best presenter – his delivery was so engaging that I lost all track of time. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more around mobile development.<br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Charles Okot <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Software Engineer<br /> I see DevDay as an opportunity to get together with teams we barely come into contact with and see all the innovative stuff everyone else is busy with. I learned so much from this DevDay – there are plenty of things we don’t know about! I thought the full CMS and that 3D Programming is available in the browsing was awesome! For me, Matt stood out as the best speaker and his presentation was very impressive. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more cutting-edge ways in which we can do our jobs. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Megan Van Rooyen <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Software Engineer <br /> This was my first DevDay and it was a great chance for people to show off the innovations they are busy with outside of work and boots. The 3D GS, Web GL and Team Building presentations impressed me. I learned how to use JavaScript Libraries and Browser-use, too. For me, Rishal stood out as the best presenter. He presented on new innovations in a way that everyone could understand. For the next DevDay, I would like to see something on Oculus Rift and Google Phone Blocks. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Joe Niemand <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Software Engineer <br /> DevDay gives me time to join the rest of the team and find out all about new technologies and calibration. It’s an incredible chance to learn and also get some 1-UP points in one go! The presentation ‘What Makes a Successful Team’ was brilliant. I learned what it takes to be a charismatic leader, which is a key factor in any successful team. For the next DevDay, I would like to see even more of the innovative ideas presented at every DevDay! <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Gail Shaw <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Technical Lead <br /> DevDay is a break from the ordinary, giving people the opportunity to showcase ‘not-so-serious’ presentations in a less formal setting. I enjoy attending DevDay because I am able to gain more presentation experience and practice, which helps me to improve on my presenting skills. I was impressed with the automatic movie downloader and also came to realise that I can’t read code! Rishal stood out as the best presenter – not only is he engaging but his knowledge is also very impressive. For the next DevDay, I would like to see anything ground-breaking and cutting-edge. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Chester Cobus <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Software Engineer <br /> I see DevDay as an opportunity to learn all about new technologies and I looked forward to the awesome presentations and technologies that were covered during the day. I learned so much from the presentations on 3D technology, 3D games in JavaScript and light control through a website. It was amazing stuff! Rishal stood out as the best presenter because his enthusiasm and passion is contagious! For the next DevDay, I would to see more around mobile technology. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Lwazi Prusent <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Software Engineer <br /> I like attending DevDay because we get to learn about new things, new frameworks and then of course, there are always the gourmet milkshakes at the end! I was blown away by the Web GL, the JavaScript Libraries and the Automatic Movie Downloader. Gail stood out as the best presenter. I think she’s witty and canny, and I think PSOs are so cool! For the next DevDay, I would like to see a greater focus on gaming. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Jonathan Counihan <br /> <strong>Designation:</strong> Team Lead <br /> DevDay gives us the chance to learn about new projects, listen to interesting topics and socialise with teams we don’t get to see very often. Earning 1-UP points for attending is another added bonus. The Android Development and the 3D Programming JavaScript presentations were great. I also got some useful ideas for team success and where to use node. I enjoyed listening to Matt and Trevor – both of them really grabbed and held my attention. For the next DevDay, I would like to see more external speakers and a focus on topics such as the insightful teambuilding presentation by Trevor. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Janine Coelho <br /> <strong>Designation: </strong>Senior Software Engineer<br /> I love being a part of the DevDay crew, which means I am at every DevDay listening to some very cool interesting talks. The Al-SQL, teambuilding and gaming development talks were phenomenal. Trevor stood out as the best presenter because he was engaging and gave an insightful teambuilding talk. For the next DevDay, I would like to see any new innovations. <br /> <br /> <strong>Name:</strong> Rishal Hurbans <br /> <strong>Designation: </strong>Team Lead <br /> DevDay, gives us the opportunity to share knowledge with one another and as I want to share my knowledge, I like to present… which means that I have to be there! I thoroughly enjoyed the information on the Raspberry Pi’s and all its uses – MINDBLOWING! Justin stood out as the best presenter because he delivered a stimulating and thoughtful presentation, which was truly inspiring. For the next DevDay, I wouldn’t mind seeing more of the same topics – innovation all the way! <br /> <br /> Yet again, DevDay was hugely successful. Those who attended not only had the benefit of great presentations but were also inspired by seeing new innovations first hand. The next Entelect DevDay will be in January 2015, so watch this space!<br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/dev_day.jpg" width="100%" /> <br />]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Deloitte confirms that Entelect is the best company to work for in Southern Africa</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect was ranked overall winner in all three categories of the Survey in which its employees participated. These were the ‘Best Company to Work For in SA (50–300 staff)’, the ‘Best Small Company to Work For in Southern Africa’, as well as the ‘Best Information Technology Company to Work For (all sizes)’.<br /> <br /> The annual survey, conducted by Deloitte (<a href="http://www.deloitte.co.za" target="_blank">http://www.deloitte.co.za</a>) since 2000, is regarded as the leading survey of its kind in Southern Africa and includes participating companies from South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. The survey aims to provide an objective measure of employee’s experiences against the market norm. The primary areas of evaluation included are:<br /> <ul id="careersList"> <li> Employees’ sense of confidence in the organisation</li> <li> The company’s organisational ethics and integrity</li> <li> The company’s operational effectiveness</li> <li> Employees’ relationship with manager/supervisor</li> <li> Employees’ sense of inclusion in the organisation</li> <li> Employees’ overall job satisfaction</li> <li> Career development </li> <li> Employee work-life balance</li> <li> Performance and recognition</li> <li> Remuneration</li> </ul> <p> <br /> Employees complete the survey anonymously and the participating companies are then judged on their strong leadership, empowerment of new leaders from within their organisation, giving back to the community, their ability to remain dynamic and the quality and morale of its employees. <br /> <br /> ‘We are incredibly honoured to be recognised by these outstanding awards and would like to say a huge thank you to all our staff members, who make Entelect the company that it is,’ says Shashi Hansjee, managing director at Entelect. Hansjee says, ‘This recognition reflects our core goal of making our company an innovative, exciting and influential environment for the incredible talent we house, and we couldn’t be more proud of this achievement.’ <br /> <br /> These prestigious accolades follow the company’s ongoing success and growth within the South African and global customised software development field.<br /> <br /> <img alt="" height="387" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/awards.jpg" width="977" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[When Entelect Software was founded in 2001, the long-term vision was for Entelect to be the world's best software engineering and solutions company, measured by the value the company delivers to its clients, employees and the greater community. On 16 October 2014, the company took a step closer to realising this vision when Entelect was awarded not one, but three, prestigious awards in the Deloitte Best Company to Work For Survey for the Southern African region.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>About the PASS Summit</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The big conference in the SQL Server world is the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2014/Home.aspx" target="_blank">PASS Summit</a>. In  previous years, the conference boasted more than 5,000 attendees. Back in its usual haunt of Seattle, this year’s PASS Summit promises three days of the best technical sessions available. With more than 200 technical sessions across three days, there is nothing else like it. As usual, there will be too much material packed into too little time, but all the sessions will be recorded and attendees can download them free of charge, so missing a session is not a major problem.<br /> <br /> I’m presenting a 400-level session (classified ‘Expert’ level) on the Friday afternoon. The session is on the internals of one aspect of the Query Optimiser – the Cardinality Estimator. The presentation is an expanded version of the one I did for the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/24hours/2014/summitpreview/About.aspx" target="_blank">24 Hours of PASS Summit Preview</a> and goes into detail on how SQL Server estimates the number of rows that will be affected by a query operator, how it uses statistics to get accurate row estimations and what happens when it can’t use the statistics. The idea of the presentation is that once people know how SQL Server generates the row estimations, they’re much better equipped to solve problems when they encounter queries with incorrect row estimations. The session will be shown on PASStv and so anyone, whether they’re attending or not, can watch it.<br /> <br /> This year, PASS Summit is not the only conference in early November in Seattle. Microsoft has moved its MVP Summit from its usual February/March timeframe to the same week as PASS Summit. The MVP Summit is a private conference for the recipients of Microsoft’s <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Most Valuable Professional</a> award.<br /> <br /> The MVP Summit is an opportunity to sit with the SQL Server development team for presentations on future plans and upcoming features. Everything during the MVP summit is under NDA, including the agenda, so unfortunately, no details can be given on what will be shown and discussed there.<br /> <br /> To make it a triple punch, Red Gate is holding the Seattle leg of its <a href="http://sqlinthecity.red-gate.com/seattle-2014/" target="_blank">SQL in the City</a> mini-conference during the same week. SQL in the City is a technical conference with a dash of marketing. It’s run by Red Gate and there are sessions that promote their tools but not all sessions are marketing related. That said, even the ones that aren’t, are usually completely marketing focused!<br /> <br /> This year I’m co-presenting a (hopefully) half-humorous, half-serious, zero-marketing session on transaction log management entitled ‘You did WHAT to my transaction log?!?!?!?’ in which Tony Davis and I look at the various ways people mismanage their logs, the consequences of doing this and what the recommended practices are for log management.<br /> <br /> It’s a long road to Seattle… but it’s well worth it for the wealth of knowledge available to everyone attending the three conferences.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect moves offices</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The company didn’t have to move far – Entelect remains at 3 Melrose Boulevard but is now in number 13. Although the move was only 100 metres and had a few minor teething problems, the company’s brilliant team worked tirelessly to overcome the challenges. It didn’t take the team long to organise, install and add the Entelect touch to create a fresh professional setting. <br /> <br /> Entelect now has more meeting rooms, a larger boardroom and kitchen, more space for the development team, all new furniture and a revamped bar and chill-out area. The staff quickly and comfortably settled in and seamlessly continued working with clients on current projects. <br /> <br /> The office was officially opened on the 17 October 2014, where employees (and some clients who happened to be in the area!) joined Managing Director Shashi Hansjee in a ceremonial ribbon cutting and raised a glass to Entelect’s continued success. <br /> <br /> The event was also cause for another celebration. Entelect won the 2014 “Best Company To Work For” award for the Southern Africa region in the annual Deloitte Best Company to Work for Survey – <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=40834" target="_blank">http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=40834</a><br /> <br /> With the team enjoying the new facilities and business carrying on at full steam, Entelect looks forward to welcoming its clients and partners to this new space and sharing some of its famous coffee blends over project demos and requirements discussions.<br /> <br /> <img style="border:solid thin #CCC;" alt="" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/office-opening.jpg" /> <br />]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[At the beginning of October 2014, Entelect moved into new offices. A bigger and better space in the familiar surroundings of Melrose Arch, the move proved to be perfectly timed. Over the years, the company has grown to a staff of more than 200 employees and as such, required more space.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect ends the year with a 25 per cent growth and announces a new CEO</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The atmosphere was relaxed with many activities for staff to do at their own leisure, including water slides, volleyball, elephant experiences, game drives and massages. After presenting the internal R100K prizes and long-service awards, Entelect CEO <br /> Dr Charles Pritchard outlined the year’s highlights. <br /> <br /> The company’s highlights for 2014 include: <ul id="careersList"> <li> Turnover and profitability are up by 25 per cent compared with last year.</li> <li> Staff has grown by 20 per cent to 208 employees – this figure excludes the additional 31 graduates joining in January 2015.</li> <li> Client numbers and the size of engagements continue to grow, with the top five biggest project clients being Discovery, Liberty, Silica, FNB and Deloitte.</li> <li> Successful launches of various internal systems that allow for more growth in the business.</li> <li> Maturation of the existing management structures and also the addition of new management roles: data solutions and service delivery.</li> <li> Delivery of successful projects in the newly formed Tech Accelerator initiative, with further innovations planned for 2015.</li> <li> Entelect’s Encentivize loyalty solution’s numbers increased and the programme now hosts 84,000 end users, with new clients including Diners Club, Old Mutual and Deloitte. Significant growth is expected in this division for 2015.</li> <li> Entelect’s MyActive events solutions hosted 96 events, which is a 43 percent jump compared with last year.</li> <li> In its annual survey Deloitte confirmed that Entelect is the best employer in Southern Africa in three categories, including the Best IT Company to Work For (all categories) – an excellent achievement considering the stature of the 160 companies that entered.</li> <li> Entelect CTO, Martin Naude, won an award as the world’s best loyalty practitioner.</li> <li> Entelect featured in the press, with Entelect-related articles appearing in leading magazines and newspapers.</li> <li> Staff seamlessly moved to new offices, which will better accomodate the company’s increasing staff.</li> <li> The Entelect Foundation has continued to grow, with 10 per cent of Entelect’s profits being committed to social upliftment projects every year. Successes include putting a number of children through school, weekly mentorship by staff volunteers, issuing study scholarships, assisting families financially, running a feeding scheme for unemployed people; sponsorship of a new graphic design centre at the Frances Vorwerg school for the disabled, and donating 45 percent of the shares of Entelect's contracting company to a community development education trust.</li> <li> The hosting of many more events by the company's social committee throughout the year, from braais and sports events to family days.</li> </ul> <br /> Before closing off the day’s proceedings, Pritchard congratulated the top 1Up contenders for their efforts in going beyond the call of duty for Entelect, with the winning employee announced as Warren Bonn. In closing, Pritchard made special mention of Managing Director Shashi Hansjee, announcing that Hansjee will be taking over as CEO. Pritchard praised Hansjee saying, “Shashi joined Entelect in 2005 as a software engineer and has had an illustrious career at Entelect since. In a short space of time he was leading big projects, was promoted to technical director and later managing director.” Pritchard noted, “Shashi was particularly successful in his role as MD because he is prepared to do operations and administrative work as well as set the direction for the business, and most importantly, he understands people. He has done a brilliant job in selecting and nurturing our current management team, and until recently, he made the time to see every single employee in regular performance reviews – something very few MDs of a company this size would and could do. Today, I can say with confidence that Shashi runs the ship, and will continue to run and steer the Entelect in the right direction.” <br /> <br /> Pritchard continued, “It is for this reason that I am bidding farewell to my position as CEO and am officially handing over the reins to Shashi today! I will be staying on as chairman of the board, and of course will always be involved with Entelect and will continue to provide guidance and support to our management team.” Pritchard closed off by announcing that his next personal mission is to help people get closer to God and to further help the poor of South Africa. He explained, “In October last year, I was graced with a vision of Christ on the cross, which has had a profound effect on my life over the last year and literally has lit the fire in my heart to pursue this mission with God at its centre.” He affirmed, “I feel that the company’s success is purely as a result of God’s grace because of the way we conduct our business – with integrity and in true service of others, be it towards staff, clients or our extended communities – and is the reason why Entelect will continue to be successful in the future.” <br /> <br /> Hansjee thanked Pritchard for his contributions and noted, “It’s great to see our founder using his time and resources to do good”. He added that this will be a seamless transition, and that Entelect’s strong management team will continue to drive the business forward. Hansjee says that Entelect will continue developing its presence as the place to be for South Africa’s top software talent, with further emphasis on showcasing Entelect’s technical capability. In addressing the staff, Hansjee said, “I am honoured and excited to continue to work with all of you to drive this great organisation towards the greatness I know we can achieve.”]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect’s Technology Accelerator Programme is a huge hit</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[A Technology Accelerator project is a software project that must be developed to achieve a predefined outcome, for example to learn a new technology, showcase a framework, solve a business problem, complete a fully specified system or create a potential product. Employees are given time during working their week to work on their Technology Accelerator projects. They have the full support of Entelect senior managers and technical leads, who guide and mentor them through the process. Employees can also join forces and work together on single projects. Employees can join the programme at any time from the beginning of the year but the projects must be completed and ready to present to a judging panel by mid-October. <br /> <br /> Judging this year was held at the African Pride Hotel in Melrose Arch, where renowned tech journalist Nafisa Akabor and TechHuman.com editor Brendon Ambrose joined the Entelect senior management judges – Shashi Hansjee (CEO), Yatish Parshotam (GM: Communications), Sheldon Lyne (GM: Operations) and Matthew Butler (GM: Projects). Each participant was given 15 minutes to present their projects and these projects were judged on technology innovation, complexity, completeness and quality of presentation, among other criteria. Scores were tallied and the results and prizes were handed out at Entelect’s year-end function at the Askari Lodge (<a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=43012" target="_blank">http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=43012</a>). <br /> <br /> The winner of the best group project was handed to project “Beep” by Rishal Hurbans, Rushil O’Jageer and Ross Badenhorst, and the team took away a prize of R30,000 to share. Beep is a highly extensible notifications framework that provides real-time notifications of new content from various sources. The prize for the best individual project went to the Projects Dashboard, which is already used at Entelect HQ to track the health of the builds of our various projects. Duane McKibbin walked away with a prize of R15000. The second place prize of R10000 went to Grant Marais’ JavaScript music visualiser, Pulsar. All other participants received R1000 worth of 1Up points (Entelect’s internal rewards programme). <div>  </div> <div> This was the first year that Entelect has run this programme and it was a huge success. New technologies were learnt, working systems were completed, there were laughs and tears, and all participants agreed that the Technology Accelerator should stay as part of Entelect’s internal suite of training for the long term.<br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/tech-accelerator.jpg" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>A trio of conferences</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The trio of conferences started on the Sunday morning with the MVP Summit. This is Microsoft’s annual gathering of MVPs, where the company shows off new and upcoming features of its products and elicits comments, suggestions and criticisms from the MVPs. In the case of the SQL group, there’s often a lot of criticism! While everything discussed during the MVP summit is under NDA (which results in some amusing tweets during the conference), some of the highlights of the conference have since been announced publically and so can be discussed. These include: <ul id="careersList"> <li>Sharding for Windows Azure SQL Database (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/frcogno/archive/2014/11/04/sneak-peek-horizontal-scale-using-azure-sql-database-elastic-scale-preview-day-1.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/frcogno/archive/2014/11/04/sneak-peek-horizontal-scale-using-azure-sql-database-elastic-scale-preview-day-1.aspx</a>)</li> <li>Updatable, non-clustered columnstore indexes, including for Hekaton tables</li> <li>Stretching tables from a physical SQL installation to Azure SQL DB (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2014/11/06/pass-summit-keynote.aspx" target="_blank">http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2014/11/06/pass-summit-keynote.aspx</a>).</li> </ul> <br /> On the Monday, Red Gate ran the Seattle leg of its SQL in the City. These mini-conferences are a mixture of technical training and marketing material and there’s usually a good balance between the two. Tony Davis (editor for Red Gate Software) and I presented a technical session entitled ‘You did WHAT to my transaction log?!?!?’ The session aimed to show just how bad things can become if people try quick solutions to log growth, without bothering to understand how the log is used and how it works.<br /> The annual PASS Summit started with a bang on the Wednesday morning, but fizzled out with the boring, marketing-focused keynote that followed. One of these days we will have technical keynotes on both days, but until then… As an aside, <a href="https://cwebbbi.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/pass-summit-2014-day-2-keynote-a-masterclass-in-cloud-databases-and-also-a-masterclass-in-tech-marketing/" target="_blank">Chris Webb’s blog post</a> on some of the reasons why the Wednesday keynote was badly received makes for an interesting and enlightening read.<br /> <br /> As expected, nothing major was announced at the PASS Summit because we are halfway through a development cycle for SQL Server – no dates were given for vNext. There were some Windows Azure SQL Database announcements (unfortunately these did not include a shorter name for it), but they did include sharding and some hints as to the features that will be in vNext. These could incorporate updatable, nonclustered columnstore indexes and stretch tables to Windows Azure SQL Database.<br /> <br /> Without much effort, the rest of Wednesday far exceeded the keynote in interest. Buck Woody discussed relevant data storage options, making the very, very important point that not everything should be shoehorned into a single solution just because that is the hammer. If part of an application’s data persistence fits naturally into a document database and half into a graph database, that is where they should go, and they shouldn’t both be crammed into something inappropriate.<br /> <br /> Conor Cunningham, architect on the SQL team, introduced a feature for SQL Server vNext, called the Query Store. In a nutshell, Query Store is a persisted record of query performance, broken down by object and query and user-chosen interval. This feature will, in most cases, make it unnecessary to run trace/extended events sessions to capture a system’s query workload, because it will be done continually in the background. Its best feature is that since it’s persisted, a database backup will contain all the Query Store information with no additional work required.<br /> <br /> Thursday started with a technical keynote from Dr Rimma Nehme, who works at the Microsoft Jim Gray Systems Lab. She gave an excellent technical presentation on cloud computing — for the record, she says we should blame the network people for the name ‘Cloud’. The rest of the day was just as good, with Paul Randal talking about advanced recovery options (including using hex editors on database files) and Bob Ward spending three hours talking about SQL Server IO.<br /> <br /> By Friday, although many delegates were worn out, there was still a good-size audience for my session on the cardinality estimator. However, the later scheduling of the session could have been the reason for there being fewer questions and interaction than I would have liked. That said, all in all, the three conferences made another excellent week of technical training, friendship and learning.<br />   <table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="" height="300" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PassSummit.png" /></td> <td><img alt="" height="300" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PassPresentation.png" /></td> <td><img alt="" height="300" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/GailPassSummit.png" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table align="middle" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 50%;"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width: 100%; text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="300" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/PassCommunityWall.png" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Query Store – the best thing for performance tuning since Extended Events</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>To understand what makes the Query Store such a revolution, a little background on SQL’s built-in performance monitoring is necessary. To start with, by default, there are no traces or event sessions that record query performance. The argument has always been that the overhead is unacceptable. The only traces and event sessions that are enabled by default are a default trace and a very light-weight system health extended events session. SQL tracks query performance stats but only in an aggregated form. Aggregated since the query plan was cached, which for a frequently run query could be just after the server started. Additionally, these performance stats are not persisted, so if SQL is restarted (as too often happens when there’s a performance-related incident), they are all lost.</div> <div> </div> <div>If someone asks me to help them to identify the cause of a performance problem that they had the previous day, at the moment the answer would be, ‘There’s no way to do so.’ Unless the person had traces or extended events sessions running, third-party monitoring tools or custom benchmarks, there won’t be enough information available a day later to identify the cause of performance problems. However, with the Query Store, SQL automatically tracks the run-time performance characteristics of queries, including CPU usage, duration, reads, row count, degree of parallelism and memory usage. These stats are stored per statement and object/batch and persisted within the database, aggregated over a time interval chosen by the DBA, defaulting to one hour. </div> <div> </div> <div>The Query Store includes the same query hash that we have had in the query stats DMVs since SQL 2008, allowing easy identification of ‘similar’ queries – queries that have the same form but differ by embedded constants. This is fantastic: it means that when the previously mentioned scenario occurs, the answer is no longer that there’s no way to do so, but rather, ‘Can you get me a backup of the DB from after that performance problem?’ or if backups cannot be provided, ‘Can you run these queries and send me the results?’ It means that it is possible to diagnose the cause of performance problems days, weeks, even months after the incident occurred. </div> <div><br /> If that is not enough, the Query Store allows for the forcing of a plan. Not using complex WITH PLAN hints or by creating plan guides, but simply by associating a query ID, from the Query Store, with a plan ID, also from the Query Store. The selected plan is then forced for that query until the association is removed. Forcing plans is still something of a last resort for query tuning, but at least now it’s easier to do.</div> <div> </div> <div>The Query Store, when it is available, will be a massive improvement in the area of performance tuning for SQL databases. It alone would make upgrading to the next version of SQL worthwhile, even if there were no other new features at all. It’s just that good!</div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>SQL Europe</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com" target="_blank">SQLSaturday</a> is a free mini-conference run by the local SQL usergroup and as the name suggests, it is usually held on a Saturday (though there have been a couple held on a Friday). To date, there have been around 370 SQLSaturdays held on six continents and around 40 more are scheduled or in the planning phase.<br /> <br /> SQLSaturday has more than 20 sessions, ranging from DBA-centric to data analysis and cloud computing, along with a pre-con day on the Friday, which offers a full-day’s training, though not for free. Along with a number of local and other international speakers, I’ll be giving a presentation there. I’ll be talking about <a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=374&sessionid=27444" target="_blank">database corruption</a>, what should be done to ensure that a DBA is prepared if corruption strikes and what the DBA should do if a database really does become corrupt. The presentation covers backup strategies and the need for tested backups, options for consistency checks, monitoring and alerts. It also covers what a DBA should, and most importantly shouldn’t do, should the database become corrupt.<br /> <br /> The week following SQLSaturday Vienna is the <a href="http://sqlbits.com" target="_blank">SQL Bits</a> conference. SQL Bits, one of the largest SQL conferences in Europe, is back in London this year with an expanded agenda. With two training days offering full-day presentations, two days of general sessions and the free Community Day on Saturday, SQL Bits has a lot to offer. SQLBits runs from 4–7 March 2015 and is held at the ExCeL London Exhibition and Convention Centre.<br /> <br /> SQLBits has grown from strength to strength over the years and it boasts a huge list of top international speakers. Some of the best-looking sessions include Itzik Ben-Gan’s ‘<a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/Boost_your_T-SQL_with_the_APPLY_Operator" target="_blank">Boost your T-SQL with the APPLY Operator</a>’. Knowing Itzik, this will include some wicked-smart use of Apply that no one else had even considered. Bob Ward’s session ‘<a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/Troubleshooting_the_Memory_of_SQL_Server" target="_blank">Troubleshoot the memory of SQL Server</a>’ also promises to be enthralling. Bob is a principal escalation engineer for Microsoft’s Customer Support, which essentially means that he fixes problems that no one else can figure out how to solve. His presentations are well known for being overloaded with information. Lastly, on the Saturday, Grant Fritchey will present ‘<a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/Execution_Plans_What_Can_You_Do_With_Them" target="_blank">Execution plans. What can you do with them?</a>’ where he shows just how much information there is hiding in an execution plan.<br /> <br /> I’m presenting two sessions this year for SQL Bits: an introductory talk on <a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/On_Transactions_and_Atomic_Operations">database transactions</a> on the Thursday and a two-hour dive into <a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/All_about_Indexes" target="_blank">indexes</a> on the Friday. The transactions presentation is an introductory look at SQL’s transactions. It is aimed at people fairly new to T-SQL development and aims to clear up myths and misunderstandings about what transactions do, what they don’t do, why they should be used and when, and how they interact with isolation levels and error handling The indexing presentation is one of SQLBit’s new double-length sessions. In it I’ll be covering index architecture and then looking at how that architecture affects choices for the clustered index. Most of the session will be spent looking at how nonclustered indexes are used and how they should be selected to give the best possible improvement to the application performance.<br /> <br /> With so much to look forward to and so many presentations to plan, it looks like March is going to be a busy month!]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The 2015 R100K Challenge is out of this world</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[With the competition now officially open for entries, this year’s challenge plays homage to the classic arcade game Space Invaders, and will once again see both novice and professional coders stretch their artificial intelligence (AI) skills, battling it out for the coveted R100,000 prize.<br /> <br /> The increasingly popular Entelect R100K Challenge series was originally launched in 2012. It is aimed at the coding, software development and gaming communities in South Africa. According to Entelect’s General Manger of Resourcing, Tim Kroon, entries have increased exponentially each year. Kroon says, ‘We are really excited about what this year’s challenge will bring. This is set to be our biggest R100K Challenge yet and we are sure that our carefully selected 2015 Space Invaders theme will inspire innovative and creative ideas from all entrants.’ <br /> <br /> Entrants to this year’s R100K Challenge will once again be required to write an AI player - or bot - for the provided Space Invaders platform. ‘Each entrant’s bot will need to be designed specifically to outsmart and outplay its opponents, and only the most intelligent, effective and innovative bots will survive and make it into the semi-finals for our advanced pool. However, we do have a beginners’ pool that will allow less-experienced contestants to have a shot at a prize of R50,000, so there really is an opportunity for everyone to get involved this year,’ explains Kroon. <br /> <br /> To even the playing field, entrants are categorised into novice and advanced skill pools, A and B respectively. A separate category will be opened to GUI (Graphical User Interface) challengers. This will allow developers with a creative flair to try their hand at crafting the style, look and feel of the game. Entelect will also focus on students for this year’s Challenge because the company has recognised the incredible, untapped range of AI skills among this network. The company invites all students and school-goers to take part and test their theoretical knowledge on a practical platform. Kroon says, ‘Not only is this a great opportunity to enjoy a challenging gaming experience and network with some of the best South Africa has to offer in the field, but you could also be the next winner!’<br /> <br /> ‘Entelect is incredibly proud to partner once again with leading publication, NAG, which continues to provide fantastic support and visibility for the R100K Challenge,’ says Kroon. ‘In addition, we are pleased to announce that Sony Mobile has come on board as this year’s product sponsor and will be providing a host of fantastic prizes from their latest Xperia range.’ <br /> <br /> The competition is now open. Following a knock-out tournament, a semi-final event will be held in September 2015, showcasing the ‘entrants to watch’ and their leading bots. Thereafter, the competition will reach its climax at the 2015 rAge, where the finals will be held and this year’s winners of R100,000 (Pool A), R50,000 (Pool B) and runner-up prizes will be announced. <br /> <br /> For more information or to enter, please visit <a href="http://challenge.entelect.co.za/" target="blank">http://challenge.entelect.co.za.</a>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>SA companies get creative to attract young ICT talent</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The need for more tech-savvy employees, who possess the required skill sets to effectively work in dynamic, highly technical environments, has increased exponentially. ‘However, while Africa offers boundless opportunities within the ICT space, there is a critical skills shortage, particularly in South Africa when compared to our counterparts across Africa,’ explains Tim Kroon, General Manager of Resourcing at Entelect. ‘With a youth unemployment rate of more than one-third of young South Africans, mainly as a result of a lack of skills, we are seeing some compelling efforts from the private sector to improve ICT education levels and attract more young people to a field that provides opportunities across every business sector.’ <br /> <br /> ‘Various companies and institutions have set up ICT-focussed educational funds and charities, skills development programmes and upskilling incentives,’ says Kroon. Among the most successful of these is Entelect’s annual R100K Challenge, supported by partners Sony Mobile and NAG magazine. Now in its fourth year, the R100K Challenge hopes to encourage students to pursue a career in ICT, as well as help professional programmers to continuously learn and develop their own skills. Kroon elaborates, ‘There are specific skills required to take part in a challenge such as this, which we hope will encourage more young people to improve their skills within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, with a view towards entering the ICT skills arena once their studies are complete.’ <br /> <br /> Kroon goes on to explain that the R100K Challenge plays an important role in attracting people to the local development community. He says that it presents a compelling incentive to student or novice coders and professional developers alike. This year, the R100K Challenge’s retro-gaming theme of Space Invaders is specifically designed to test the artificial intelligence (AI) skills of entrants in a face-off competition, where candidates are required to write the code for their own designed bot. ‘The necessary skills to win the R100K Challenge are relevant to the industry at large. Winning requires not only the ability to write the code, but also to think strategically. Entrants will need to engage their skills of critical analysis and a structured process of testing and optimisation,’ says Kroon. As the competition grows each year, so it is modified to cater to its entrants. For example, this year the Player Portal has been launched. Here, players are able to upload their code and test it properly, offering the chance to iron out any flaws. These elements are reflective of the industry and could help prepare entrants for making the leap into the marketplace of software engineering, where professionals are primarily responsible for writing, designing and testing of computer programs. <br /> <br /> With the global ICT industry now producing trillions of rands’ worth of value within a myriad of industries, Kroon says that it is Entelect’s hope that the increasingly popular R100K Challenge will continue to encourage and introduce more young people to the field of programming and development, and that it will highlight the massive opportunities for them in this essential industry. ‘Choosing to study within the field of ICT disciplines puts students at a great advantage when entering the marketplace, while simultaneously improving South Africa’s capabilities and economic outlook,’ says Kroon. ‘There are significant professional benefits to mastering computer programming topics, such as logic, patterns and problem solving. For students moving into computer science at tertiary level, having a background or introduction to computer programming at a high-school level will, of course, be a distinct advantage.’ <br /> <br /> The increase in local skills will play an important role in enhancing South Africa’s competitiveness on the global ICT stage. This will promote job creation and the opportunity for South Africa to ensure the country is able to depend on its own local products and services to meet its ICT needs, rather than outsourcing skills from other countries. It may even create the capacity for South Africa to export these skills. Kroon concludes, ‘This ability will drastically improve our economic outlook in the age of the knowledge economy, and as such, we encourage other public sector organisations to take part in the drive to attract young people to our industry, through supporting existing incentives and programmes or creating their own.’]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<h3> Tim Kroon (Entelect Software: General Manager of Resourcing)</h3> <br/><br/> In today’s technological and data driven economy, information and communication technology (ICT) is now at the forefront of business operations. Regardless of industry or offering, to remain competitive and see their business survive in the digital era, organisations across the globe and here in South Africa, have become increasingly reliant on technology and software solutions.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>SQL Europe conferences</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The SQLSaturday events are free, one-day mini-conferences hosted by the various SQL Server usergroups across the world. So far there have been 400 SQL Saturday events across six continents.<br /> <br /> On the 28 February, the Austrian SQL Server usergroups hosted <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/374/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday in Vienna</a>. There were more than 300 attendees from all across Austria and beyond. My presentation on database corruption had a large and enthusiastic audience.<br /> <br /> The database corruption session is mostly about things that DBAs can do so that if their database ever does become corrupt, they can recover easily. The focus of the presentation is around backups, recovery plan, monitoring and alerts. The second part is on what to do if corruption is detected, and the focus there is on understanding the errors and ensuring that actions taken don’t make the problem worse.<br /> <br /> The keynote was given by Mark Souza of Microsoft’s Customer Advisory Team, who discussed a number of features that may or may not be coming in future versions of SQL Server.<br /> <br /> After SQL Saturday, it was time to make the trip across Europe to London for the <a href="http://sqlbits.com/" target="_blank">SQL Bits</a> conference. I had two accepted sessions for the conference: a regular session on transactions and a double-length session on indexes.<br /> <br /> The session on transactions had a small but attentive audience. In it, I covered the concept of atomicity and how transactions guarantee atomicity. I also looked at how locks locks interact with transactions and ended with an examination of error handling and the necessarily of catching errors that can occur within transactions.<br /> <br /> The indexing session was full, standing-room only! The session covered index architecture in brief, touching on how index trees work. A good understanding of index architecture often makes figuring out how and why SQL uses particular indexes easy.  Despite some minor AV problems, the session went spectacularly: attentive audience, good questions, great feedback, even if I did find a mistake on one of the slides. With index architecture out of the way, I spent the rest of the session looking at design considerations for the clustered index and then looking at how the queries that run against a table will affect the nonclustered indexes chosen for it. The video recording of the session is available on the <a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event14/All_about_Indexes" target="_blank">SQLBits site</a>.<br /> <br /> All in all, it was another very successful SQLBits conference and I’m looking forward to the next one.<br /> <br /> <img alt="" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/sqlbits.jpg" style="max-width:1170px" width="100%" />]]></content:encoded>

            <title>SQL Saturdays in South Africa</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The SQLSaturday conferences are free, one-day conferences, and as their name suggests, usually on a Saturday (though Hawaii ran its conference on a Friday), run by the local SQL Server usergroups. They provide high-quality training run entirely by volunteers. To date, there have been more than 400 SQLSaturday events on six continents since the first one was held in Orlando in late 2007.<br />  </div> <div>This will be the fifth year in a row that there’s a SQLSaturday held in Johannesburg. However, it’s the first year that we have three events running in South Africa. </div> <div><br /> Johannesburg is up first on 5 September. I’m presenting several sessions there: a full day preconference session on the Friday, as well as two sessions on the Saturday. The precon is titled ‘All about Execution Plans’ and that’s what it is. I’ll be talking the entire day on execution plans, starting with how and why they are generated, and ending with a detailed look at the operators that can appear in the plans, what they mean and how to read them. </div> <div><br /> The first session on the Saturday, titled ‘What backups?’, covers SQL’s backup options, the full, differential and log backups, what they each do and when they’d be used, as well as a discussion on restore paths for different kinds of backup. The second session on the Saturday is a more advanced session called ‘Lies, damned lies and statistics’. It looks at SQL’s statistics objects, what they are and what they are used for. It goes into detail on the part that the statistics play in the optimisation process and what can (and will) go wrong when statistics are out of date.</div> <div> </div> <div>The second Saturday of September sees SQLSaturday moving to Cape Town. Again, I’ll be delivering my talk on statistics.To complete the trio, on the 19 September, the very first SQLSaturday Durban will be held. In addition to the sessions on backups and statistics, I’m also doing a two-hour presentation on execution plans. The first half is focussed on how to read execution plans and the second, on using the execution plan to identify performance problems with queries.</div> <div><br /> To end the month on a very different note, I have the pleasure of presenting an AI paper at the SAICSIT conference in Stellenbosch … a change from the usual SQL conferences indeed.</div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Graduating soon?</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[The first two years after graduating can really accelerate your career so in many ways, accepting your first job is an important (but daunting) decision.<br /> <br /> Step one and probably the easiest thing to do, is to research the company you want to work for. In this day and age, the most obvious approach is to to scan the company’s website. This will give you a good indication of what the company does, the calibre of its clients and its approach to work. As websites are generally targeted at marketing and sales, scanning the website alone can fall short of demonstrating the company’s culture. In general, their socal media pages give a better indication of the culture. Better yet, nothing beats chatting to people who work for the prospective employer to gauge their opinion.<br /> <br /> If you are looking for a specific or niche development role, then there are a few more things to look out for. One of the most important factors that should be further researched is the ability for you to gain skills through transferable knowledge-sharing programmes. Your first job should provide a platform for you to start building a successful career. The best start would be to gain a few generalist skills, which can be applied anywhere. In this way, you will still be able to alter your career path at a later stage when you’ve worked out what you are passionate about – let's face it, most of us don’t know this when we start our first job! <br /> <br /> Look for companies that are using industry best-practice technologies, processes and methodologies and have peers that will help to elevate your game. Tied to this, consider a role that will give you the most valuable experience for the time that you are there. Avoid duties where you will be doing only repetitive tasks – you don’t want to have five years’ experience with those five years made up of you having the first year’s experience five times over!<br /> <br /> Lastly, and possibly most importanty, find a job that you enjoy – one that you feel passionate about and want to work at.]]></content:encoded>

            <title>SQL in Seattle</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To me, late October means one thing: it’s time for back-to-back conferences in Seattle, specifically the PASS Summit and the MVP Summit, with a couple of one-day mini-conferences also thrown in for good measure.</p> <p> </p> <p>PASS Summit is THE conference for SQL Server professionals. There are hundreds of sessions and thousands of attendees and it is held over a three-day period, usually in late October or early November. In addition to the three main conference days, there are two days of precon seminars, which offer full-day training courses on specific topics.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The main conference starts on the Wednesday morning with a keynote by Microsoft. This has often been where Microsoft announces releases or major features. This year, I won’t be at all surprised if there’s an announcement regarding SQL Server 2016 – perhaps its expected release date. There may very well also be Azure announcements, either around the database offering or on any of the many BI, Big Data and Machine Learning features that Azure offers. Whatever is announced, it’s sure to be a keynote not to be missed. As for the rest of the conference, it’s all about sharing and learning. Some of the sessions I’m especially looking forward to are:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <ul id="careersList"> <li>Itzik Ben-Gan talking about running totals. Itzik knows more about T-SQL than most of us have forgotten, and his sessions are always enjoyable</li> <li>Bob Ward, in his famous level 500 internals session talking about wait types, latches and spinlocks</li> <li>Advanced analytics with R in SQL Server 2016. R is a fascinating language, and one I’ve just recently started learning. R in SQL Server? Bring it!</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The sessions aren’t the only part of the PASS Summit, though. There’s the SQL Clinic where the top CSS engineers will be available to help with any SQL Server problems. There is also the Customer Advisory Team that can help with designs for SQL implementations and features big and small, and there’s the community area where there’s sure to be several SQL professionals at any time, willing to share their knowledge.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The Friday keynote is going to be a treat. Dr DeWitt, from the Jim Grey lab has given the last-day keynote on multiple occasions, always to critical acclaim and usually to a standing ovation. Last year, one of his co-workers, Dr Nehme presented the keynote and, if anything, outdid Dr DeWitt. This year, they will present the final-day keynote together on the Internet of Things (IoT). </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The week after PASS Summit, the action moves across the lakes to Bellevue and Redmond, for Microsoft’s annual MVP Summit. This is where Microsoft talks to its MVP award holders about its plans for the future of the company’s various products. Everything that occurs during the MVP summit is under NDA (including the lunch menu) but that just means that Microsoft is free to talk about things that the company is not ready to make public. It also gives the the MVPs a chance comment on, and often criticise, those plans. <br />  <br /> While the agenda is NDA, what I’m expecting and hoping to see is a mixture of features coming in SQL 2016 and longer-term plans for the future of SQL Server and entire data platform as a whole.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>All in all, between PASS and the MVP summit, it’s going to be a busy, but great, trip.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Deloitte Best Company to Work for Survey 2015</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="" src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/DeloitteImage.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; border:solid thin #CCC; clear:both" width="300" /> The survey aims to identify and celebrate the best companies to work for, based on employee’s experiences. Employees complete the survey, anonymously giving honest and reliable feedback, which in turn can be used by companies to shape and develop their employee’s talent, as well create an improved work environment. <br/><br/> The primary areas of evaluation included are: <br/><br/> <ul id="careersList"> <li>Value and culture of the company</li> <li>Leadership</li> <li>Working relationship with supervisors and managers</li> <li>Inclusion</li> <li>Operational effectiveness</li> <li>Job satisfaction</li> <li>Performance and recognition</li> <li>Remuneration</li> <li>Learning and Development</li> <li>Fairness and equality.</li> </ul> <br/> Last year, <a href="http://www.entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=40834" target="_blank">Entelect was awarded first place</a> in all three categories of the Survey in which its employees participated. These were the ‘Best Company to Work For in SA (50–300 staff)’, the ‘Best Small Company to Work For in Southern Africa’, as well as the coveted ‘Best Information Technology Company to Work For (all sizes)’. This year, instead of awarding first, second and third places, Deloitte has changed the scoring system to present Standard of Excellence Achievement awards to all companies that attain mean scores within certain bands. Companies achieve gold, silver and bronze awards, depending on these scores. <br/><br/> Overall, Entelect has been awarded the Gold Achiever Award and the company’s highest individual score was for <em>Values and Culture</em> – earning a total score of 4.57. This subsection measures how aligned an organisation’s employees are to the company’s values and culture. Entelect prides itself on its strong company values and culture, and this high score reflects that the culture of the company has filtered down from management to other employees. <br/><br/> Entelect’s next-highest score was for <em>Leadership</em> and the total score of 4.51 shows that employee’s generally have good relationships with managers, and feel that they are being guided to achieve their career goals. Entelect scored a total of 4.48 for <em>Engagement</em>, which is a reflection on the company’s active social committee as well as the team leads and account managers. About this high score, Entelect’s Data Manager, Ryan Naudé said, ‘Keeping all Entelectuals engaged has been a priority since day one and it’s great to be able to measure this and see that the approach is working.’ <br/><br/> As with any job, employee satisfaction is crucial to the overall success of the company. Keeping a growing workforce happy can be difficult but Entelect’s score of 4.33 for the <em>Employee Satisfaction</em> subsection shows that management is committed to ensuring that the majority of the work the company takes on, provides personal fulfillment to its staff. <br/><br/> As a result of Entelect’s growth over the past year, the company had nearly 50 percent more respondents. It has also increased its overall score from last year’s 4.33 to 4.40 this year – making Entelect truly one of the best companies to work for in Southern Africa. <br/><br/>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect's 2016 graduate programme</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[So far this year, Entelect has hired 30 top-of-the-class graduates and post-graduates from reputable institutions across the country. These individuals are currently undergoing Entelect’s graduate bootcamp to accelerate their careers. Bootcamp includes two months of intensive practical training on software development in an enterprise environment, using the industry’s most popular technology platforms, as well as being guided by Entelect’s best technology leaders.<br /> <br /> The graduate programme offers the services of these graduates to existing Entelect clients on a no-cost and no-commitment basis for up to three months. With companies investing in their own graduate work-force and with low market confidence in entry-level skills, this programme is designed to provide an incentive to utilise high-calibre graduate skills and to take advantage of the hands-on experience and low ramp-up times that the Entelect Graduate Boot Camp provides, at entry level rates.<br /> <br /> <img src="http://cdn.entelectonline.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Grads2016.jpg" width="100%" /><br />   <div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFNj6fzOIAc" style="max-width:560px" width="100%"></iframe><br /> Tim Kroon speaks about graduate opportunities and the 2016 Entelect graduate programme.</div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>SQL server conferences, European style</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For passionate software engineers and developers, there are a series of firsts taking place in Europe this week. In London the first <a href="http://insidesql.co.uk/">InsideSQL</a> conference will be offering a deep-dive only conference on SQL Server, and will be followed by the first ever <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/516/eventhome.aspx">SQLSaturday</a> to be hosted in Iceland.  </p> <p> </p> <p>In London, the first session I will be hosting is on wait statistics, looking at the SQL Server execution model and why we have waits at all. Then, looking at some common wait types, what they signify and what should and should not be done when encountering those waits.</p> <p> </p> <p>The second session is a modification of the very popular indexing session, with more internals and more details to satisfy those people looking for advanced presentations. Here, there will be a lot more detail about the internal structure of SQL’s b-tree indexes, how seeks and scans work and what the internal structure means for index design.</p> <p> </p> <p>After London, Iceland’s <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/516/eventhome.aspx">SQLSaturday</a> conference is where I’ll be giving a precon on execution plans as well as a regular session on the Query Store. The precon is a full day dive into the query optimiser, plan caching, plan reuse, structure of a plan, query operators and how to use the plan to tune queries.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Query Store presentation starts with the basics, since it’s a new feature. I’ll look at what the Query Store is, how to enable and configure it and how it works. After that I’ll show how the Query Store can be used to identify the worst performing queries and plan regressions and how its plan forcing feature can take the risk out of version upgrades.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Educating and empowering the youth starts with us</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Africa has one of the worst youth unemployment problems in the world, with some estimates holding that less than half the population under 35 are employed. The percentage of black African professional, managerial and technical workers aged 25 to 34 has dropped by 2% over the past 20 years, leaving that generation less skilled than previous ones – and less skilled than every other race and age group, according to a recently survey by Statistics South Africa.</p> <p> </p> <p>Little has changed since 2009 when Stats SA last did the survey. As in 2009, 57% of people with less than matric remain unemployed, while those with a matric recorded unchanged unemployment levels of 38%.</p> <p> </p> <p>More than 98% of children who should be getting a primary education do attend school - but simply being in school is not enough. We need our children to be educated properly. Only 35% of children in Grade 3 are able to pass the literacy and numeracy tests for that age group. Where are the skills going to come from that we so desperately need to create jobs in SA now and in future generations?</p> <p> </p> <p>Business has a clear role to play in improving the situation. Strategically aligned corporate social investment initiatives can go a long way towards educational upliftment in our country. The Entelect Foundation, for example, provides curriculum tutoring, life skills advice and basic support to pupils and their parents in a number of communities in Johannesburg. We spend 10% of all pre-tax profits on school fees and basic expenses such as food and transport for these kids. It might seem like a small contribution when taken in context of the country’s dire needs, but for those families who receive the benefits, it means the world.</p> <p> </p> <p>As the economy moves from primary and secondary-based to tertiary based, opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled workers will decrease. Many citizens aspire to a university education, seeing it as a cure-all for unemployment. But it’s becoming increasingly evident that a back-to-basics approach is needed: a strong focus on equipping South Africans with a solid education from the ground up, particularly when it comes to literacy and numeracy.</p> <p> </p> <p>Youth must also be encouraged to complete their schooling by providing them with a quality learning experience. As for tertiary education, youth who choose to study so-called scarce skills, like maths and science, will have the edge in the job market. To help this process, we sit on university advisory boards to help ensure that tertiary education and industry are aligned. More than 30% of our current staff base joined as graduates with no prior work experience.</p> <p> </p> <p>Government and business need to work together to improve the employment situation. Government has the scale to reach the young and unemployed and make the long-term commitment needed to educate our children. The business community knows which skills are needed and what it takes to make someone employable.</p> <p> </p> <p>There is a mismatch between formal-sector industry expectations and the understanding of first-time workers in terms of professionalism, specifically, timekeeping, etiquette, accountability. Many youth also believe that rising through the ranks is effortless. They are unprepared to start at the bottom and work their way up.</p> <p> </p> <p>More businesses should also start focusing on training talented people who lack skills and experience, rather than poaching experienced employees from other companies.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, businesses need support to do this. By improving subsidies, tax incentives, BBBEE initiatives as well as a loosening of laws that impede hiring in small businesses, the government can encourage companies to support skills development and job creation, particularly for black South Africans. There are a number of programmes that can assist with this:</p> <p> </p> <p>• Encourage businesses to provide input into the way schools are run. Using expertise gained from years in the private sector, many businesses have the capability to provide effective support structures to schools to transform their management capabilities and make a real difference.</p> <p>• Campaign for people to pursue teaching careers, improve teaching salaries, while investing in improving current teachers’ skills</p> <p>• Assist companies to employ and train unskilled labour in a way that makes sense for each industry</p> <p>• Support entrepreneurs who create jobs for themselves and others</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Small business has the greatest potential for large-scale job creation. There is a lot that government can do to create an enabling environment for SMEs to access finance and training, among other things, to help them do better business. However, there is also a lot that business can do to contribute to solving the underlying problems in education and skills development. We can only make widespread improvements if we work together. This problem affects us all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Girl code event for Women’s month</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Girlcode held it's third annual event at the beginning of August. The Hackathon was timed to coincide with Women’s month and is part of a number of initiatives to encourage more girls to take a prominent role in the tech industry. This year’s event saw five teams taking part, and the winning team was awarded R10,000 cash prize.</p> <p> </p> <p>Events like these are a great platform to promote inclusivity and diversity in the industry. Although there are still far too few women in the technology space, the Girl Code Hackathon is a great way to bring the female tech community together and give them the chance to flex their tech muscles. The presentations at this year’s event is proof that diversity breeds relevant, real-world innovations.</p> <p> </p> <p>All teams presented ideas that spoke directly to women’s needs; from female health, to domestic violence and the provision of sanitary items for underprivileged girls in rural schools. The ideas got to the heart of women’s issues in South Africa and used technology in simple accessible forms, to address real needs. The winning team, ‘Supported’, pitched an alert app for women facing domestic violence.</p> <p> </p> <p>Most remarkable was the intuitive focus on women’s issues and the development of real world solutions. A number of the ideas presented were highly functional and have the potential to offer immediate benefits to society.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Hackathon took place over 24 hours but despite the competitive element, participants were keen to share their knowledge with one another; across team divides in some instances. It is community events like these that demonstrate the power of women inspiring women. Ultimately, the participants just want to share their knowledge in order to generate the best idea for society.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect is proud to support these initiatives and serving the larger development community through its attendance, sponsorships and hosting of tech related events. We look forward to many more in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect takes its DevDay to the public</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The event was part showcase, part science show, part geek club, part maker club, offering a range of lightening talks on cutting-edge technologies as well as a variety of interactive exhibition stands where people could discover the latest creative innovations in technology.</p> <p> </p> <p>DevDay was the brainchild of Entelect software and the first event took place in 2014. Since then it has grown well-beyond the company and into something for the broader community. This DevDay took the concept one step further and provided the South African community with a platform to showcase their innovations.</p> <p> </p> <p>“The initial purpose of DevDay was to give our employees an opportunity to explore aspects of the industry that they might not get exposed to in their day job, and to showcase their technology-based interests. However, the success of the event internally showed us its immense worth to the community as a whole and so we decided to open it to the public.” Explains Sheldon Lyne, General Manger, Operations, Entelect.</p> <p> </p> <p>The keynote speaker for the event was Uncle Bob who, in the last 40 years, has worked in various capacities on literally hundreds of software projects. In 2001, he initiated the meeting of the group that created Agile Software Development from Extreme Programming techniques and served as the first chairman of the Agile Alliance.  He is also a leading member of the Worldwide Software Craftsmanship Movement, Clean Code; is a regular speaker at international conferences and trade shows; and is the founder, CEO, and president of Uncle Bob Consulting, LLC and Object Mentor Incorporated. </p> <p> </p> <p>His presentation at DevDay was centred around the theme of encouraging Professionalism in the software industry, specifically talking on the topic of Estimations. According to Uncle Bob, the vast majority of software developers have yet to learn the practices and disciplines that constitute professional behavior. In his talk he focused on the practice of estimation and how these can be better managed by software developers. </p> <p> </p> <p>Other speakers at DevDay 2016 included:</p> <p>• Gail Shaw looking at what Big Data is, and isn’t, and how the meaning of the term has changed over time.</p> <p>• House4Hack presented on its ‘Five phun projects at House4Hack using the Raspberry Pi: PiScope, 3d printing with LCARS, WifiBroadCast, FPV Cars and PiFM.</p> <p>• Kristina Georgieva talking on what convolutional neural networks are, how are they used and what those in the industry could use to play around with them.</p> <p>• Evan Knowles presentation was titled, ‘More than one way to skin a QR’ and everything you ever wanted to know about QR.</p> <p>• Philip Robinson, who went into detail about the technology used and development process of an interactive LED art installation built, from scratch, for Afrikaburn 2015. His talk included a breakdown of the design and manufacture of the custom electronics built for the installation, the construction of the artwork itself and the realities of bringing a fancy toy into the middle of the desert.</p> <p>• Duncan Gillies and Nicolle Garber discussed data science techniques and approaches while using a BI and visualization tool to simplify the methodology for non-technical users. In an interesting twist he used IMBD’s movie data set to try cluster and predict a variety of metrics.</p> <p>• Dino Fizzotti whose talk was titled “’Blink the LED’ right?” covered how he learnt to write software, from making hardware and developed his use his 16shades project.</p> <p>• Pieter Koornhof, who, in his lightning talk, looked at why developers should consider working code in production, maintainable code, and having fun, the three most important things in their normal day-to-day.</p> <p> </p> <p>As well as a variety of talks, there were a number of interactive exhibition stands. Both House4hack and Sterkinekor contribute to the interactive exhibition with their stands which were greatly appreciated by everyone there. Alongside this, there were LED lights, a 3D printer, a code-off, a game jam, board games and a whole bunch of other cool tech-centric and interactive stands.</p> <p> </p> <p>“At Entelect, we believe that communities can be a powerful place to keep learning and stay ahead of the curve. The stronger and more diverse a community network, the greater chance we engineers and developers have to remain relevant in such a fast-paced sector.” Says Lyne.</p> <p> </p> <p>“As developers and leaders in the industry, we need to take ownership to drive these initiatives because we have so much knowledge to share and so many upcoming developers. There is a shortfall in good developers in South Africa but no shortage of jobs for great developers. Events like these are designed to help bridge this gap and grow the industry to its full potential.” Concludes Lyne. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect top performer at the 2016 RiskAfrica Regatta</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This last weekend, Entelect took part in the annual 2016 RISKAfrica Regatta, which hosts the financial services and insurance industry leaders from around RSA at this prestigious event. 12 race boats and 2 VIP cruises sailed from the Royal Cape Yacht Club (RCYC) harbour around the bay on open-ocean for a two-day exhibition, followed by cocktail party and a formal dinner.</p> <p> </p> <p>We hosted a few clients and their partners, including Mark Thomas (Deloitte DESMAT), Cornel Elis (Herotel) and Earl Van Zyl (Allan Gray). We also were very happy to host a business partner that we have not seen in many years: Terence Govender (now MMI), who was instrumental in our first team at Discovery Vitality and later, Zurich insurance.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect was paired with the ‘Vulcan’ yacht, a super-light carbon-fiber race boat that will be participating in the Cape-to-Rio event next year <a href="http://cape2rio2017.com/">http://cape2rio2017.com/</a> .</p> <p> </p> <p>Two race events would determine the winner: A Friday twilight event that would allow our landlubber software team to become familiar with the boat (and the welcoming crew); and the Saturday pursuit race.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ‘Entelect Explorers’ took top honours by winning the first race (we were so far ahead that we had an hour extra at the drinks bar after completing!). We then proceeded to hunt down the other boats in the Saturday pursuit race - which had team Entelect starting 34 minutes after the behind the last yacht class – and coming second by 3 minutes. Our team was live tracked by GPS and can be watched here: <a href="http://bit.ly/2eEGA1L">http://bit.ly/2eEGA1L</a></p> <p> </p> <p>I’m happy to announce that we survived the intense rigours placed on us by our race-mode Vulcan crew and with their guidance, Entelect won the overall event!</p> <p> </p> <p>This event has been months in the planning and it would not have been successful without our internal marketing and administration teams.</p> <p> </p> <p>We look forward to more client engagements soon – showing that we’re a company that continues to lead the way!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>TempDB & Query Store at this year’s Pass Summit</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another year, another October trip to Seattle. As the rain falls across the city, database professionals descend upon the Downtown area for the annual Pass Summit. The Pass Summit is one of the biggest database conferences in the world, offering industry-leading speakers, in-depth training, technical insights, and is attended by data novices and pros alike. </p> <p> </p> <p>This year, I’m presenting two sessions at the Pass Summit: TempDB and Query Store.</p> <p> </p> <p>The first is a deep dive into TempDB, looking at what uses TempDB and why. Then looking at two kinds of contention that can be seen with TempDB; IO contention and allocation contention. IO contention comes from driving the IO subsystem harder than it is capable of, resulting in slow response when reading or writing to disk. Whereas, Allocation contention comes from SQL’s file structures, and occurs when tables are being created at a high frequency, resulting in processes waiting to access key allocation pages in the database. The two different forms of contention require very different approaches to resolving them, and mis-identifying the problem can result in a lot of wasted time.</p> <p> </p> <p>The second presentation I’m giving is on the Query Store, a new feature in SQL server 2016 that promises to change the way query performance monitoring is done. This presentation looks at how Query Store is configured, how it works, and shows how to debug a query performance regression using the Query Store’s built in reports.</p> <p> </p> <p>In addition, a group of MVPs are putting on a 1-day ‘freecon’ on the Monday before Pass Summit, for those who aren’t attending a preconference session but still want to spend the day learning. I’m presenting there as well, specifically, a session on misunderstood wait stats and why some waits are not as concerning as they appear to be.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect awarded for the third year in Deloitte Best Company Survey</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>Entelect awarded for the third year in Deloitte Best Company Survey</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect have been awarded two Platinum Seals in the 2016 Deloitte Best Company Survey. The seals were awarded for Best Company and Employee Engagement. The Platinum seal was introduced in 2016 to mark organizational attractiveness far beyond the traditional bronze, silver and gold awards.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Deloitte Best Company Survey has been conducted annually since 2000 and is regarded as the pre-eminent survey of its kind due to its independence and comprehensive analysis and insights.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect have chosen to participate in this survey for the past three years because it provides a unique opportunity to engage in an objective and transparent manner with our employees. The survey responses are completely anonymous, and the results report provides in-depth, constructive insights that enable the team to introduce changes that have a direct impact on our employees’ well-being and satisfaction at work.</p> <p> </p> <p>Overall the survey unpacks four main dimensions through which organisational attractiveness are assessed and managed: Accomplishment and growth, Care and feedback, Culture and values, and Fairness and integrity.</p> <p> </p> <p>In the 2016 report, Entelect achieved outstanding results in the following areas:</p> <p> </p> <p>• Best Company Index: Entelect achieved 77.76% where the industry benchmark is 62.2%</p> <p>• Employee Engagement Index: 81.28%, where the industry benchmark is 67.78%</p> <p>And,</p> <p>• 86.4% of employees were classed as positive contributors (i.e. High flyers) where the industry benchmark sits at only 61%</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The Best Company Index award measures a company’s attractiveness among its employees. It is an expression of employee’s alignment with the organization and internal brand. Where organisational attractiveness is considered a key driver for employee engagement.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Employee engagement award is a particularly important one for Entelect. Over the years, the company has been built by its employees. The culture, the opportunities for growth and accomplishment, and maintaining the drive for excellent service and professionalism, are all features that contribute towards personal growth and job satisfaction. In the Best Company Survey, this award reflects our employees’ state of mind which influences their work related behaviours and associated discretionary effort.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Some of the other top results across the four dimensions include:</p> <p>• 93% of respondents felt that in the last year they’d had the opportunity to grow and learn</p> <p>• 94% of employees believed that this company cares about developing people for long-term careers, not just the current job</p> <p>• 96% of people answered that they felt this organization attracts the best people</p> <p>• 94% of respondents felt that there is a feeling of trust throughout this organization</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>“The level of attraction achieved by Entelect is an extraordinary performance.  Results of this quality are very unusual and have only been achieved in very few organisations.” Leslie Yuill, Actuarial, Reward and Analytics Lead, Deloitte. “Entelect have a challenge ahead to continually improve so that they can maintain this status. Although it is an exceptional challenge, the results demonstrate that they have the tools in play to help them achieve this goal.”</p> <p> </p> <p>As an organization, we’ve always been driven by the belief that our employees make this company what it is. These results are testament to the commitment our employees put in daily, to ensure that the culture remains strong and true to its values of growth, delivery and relationships. These results reflect that our employees continue to feel a deep sense of ownership towards the company and we welcome survey’s such as these which provide us with insights on ways we can continually improve.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Get Your Kids Excited About Coding!</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are still very much in the midst of the Digital Revolution. This change to the economy has pushed not only technology companies to the forefront, but also traditional-industry companies who have embraced technology. Many South Africans still do not consider a career in IT a viable option (<a href="http://entelect.co.za/News/DisplayNewsItem.aspx?niid=55168">Educating and empowering the youth</a>), but it’s clear that these skills will become more and more integral to the growth of our economy in the future. Who knows, in more developed economies, coding might even become as fundamental to early education as literacy and mathematics.</p> <p>So how does one spark a child’s interest in coding? Fortunately, there are a huge number of apps and websites dedicated to this nowadays. But just leaving a child in front of a tablet or PC and hoping for the best is unlikely to inspire a real interest. Here are some tips to help them discover their potential:</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Emphasise the creative and fun aspects</p> <p>Some of the most satisfying elements of programming are the creative element and the instant gratification behind it. Coding taught in a monotonous academic way often misses out on those elements and results in kids becoming overwhelmed or indifferent. Most children love creating things, and love to see their creations in action – think painting or Lego. Look for tools that encourage exploration, that enable curiosity (“I wonder what will happen if I do this?”) and allow the child to actually see the output of what they have just done.</p> <p>For very young children, there are Apps such as Bit-by-bit or Fisher Price’s Code-a-pillar, and for kids aged 6-10, tools like ScratchJr (web-based), Daisy the Dinosaur (iPad) and HopScotch (iPad) work really well. For slightly older children, Scratch, Lightbot and Tynker (all web-based) are great options while <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com">Lego Mindstorms</a> bring a whole new feature to an old classic. For a comprehensive list and reviews of each option, head here: <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/lists/coding-apps-and-websites">commonsensemedia</a> </p> <p>Scratch and Tynker also bring in the gaming element, which is something many kids enjoy. Imagine the pride involved with creating their own computer game.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. Make it social</p> <p>Group projects can be even more rewarding, and help both the creative process and ensure that there is immediate support should a child get stuck. Look for mentors – many families will have a developer in there somewhere who will more than likely be happy to assist. Most developers understand how important coding skills are to our country’s future. A good mentor can really make the difference between a prolonged interest and becoming overwhelmed and bored.</p> <p>Alternatively, look for local kids coding groups or hackathons. This is an area where South Africa is lacking, but there are a few out there.</p> <p><a href="https://code.org/educate">Code.org</a> is an online platform that offers tutorials for elementary school level through to high school level. And <a href="http://africacodeweek.org/activities/online-courses/">Africa Code week</a> offers online courses for 8-11 year olds and upwards; both are designed to teach coding skills to budding young programmers. Locally, Entelect are running a series of Schools engagement programmes, where employees take time to talk to children at schools about possible futures in coding. A number of schools are also starting to incorporate coding into their curriculum, so look out for these opportunities where available.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Don’t force things</p> <p>Every child is different. Not all kids like to paint or play sports or read, so not every child will like to code either. Exposing the child to the tools, and showing them enough support to let them make their own mind up is key. If they don’t show immediate interest, they at least know what it’s all about and may even revisit it at a later stage of their education.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Introducing children to programming can open up paths for them in the future as these skills become integral to the growth of our economy. The skills they can learn around critical thinking, problem solving and creativity are likely to be beneficial in all sorts of walks of life. The key is to make it enjoyable. Place an emphasis on making it easy for kids to create something; allowing them see and feel the fruits of their labour, and discover their potential. Fortunately, there is an emergence of learning opportunities available to children, but don’t force kids to program – it’s a great skill to have, but by no means is it the only way to succeed in this world!</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect's Refer A Developer competition sends one lucky winner to Thailand</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Entelect launched its first Refer A Developer competition. The campaign was the first public candidate referral campaign run by Entelect and resulted in the hire of a talented young software developer earlier this year.</p> <p> </p> <p>Although several companies run internal referral campaigns and incentives, Refer A Developer was an initiative designed to reach a much broader audience than previous campaigns. Entelect is the first company in South Africa to open a competition of this nature to the public.</p> <p> </p> <p>The winner of last years’ competition was Henry Langenhoven, 25, from Centurion.  Henry was one of 112 entries who nominated themselves (or another person) to Entelect and one of only 13 people interviewed.</p> <p> </p> <p>Carmen Williams, Head of Talent Acquisition at Entelect said Henry really stood out from the crowd. “In his interview, Henry demonstrated that he had strong problem solving capabilities and through the discussion demonstrated that he has a high EQ and is very passionate about software development. We knew this was the kind of person who would do well at Entelect.”</p> <p> </p> <p>The campaign ran across social media platforms as well as on MyBroadband. The objective was for members of the public to refer a talented developer to Entelect. Entelect would then interview the top candidates and offer the best candidate a job with the company. Not to mention the additional prize of a trip for two to Thailand.  A secondary social media ‘share’ competition ran in parallel, which was won by Chris Canning, who received a R2,500 Takealot voucher.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Refer A Developer competition ran from October 2016 to 15 December 2016, and Henry started with Entelect in February 2017.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Entelect is constantly looking for exceptional Software Developers because the software market is very competitive. So, when we find people like Henry, we move quickly,” says Carmen.</p> <p> </p> <p>Based on the success of last years’ campaign, Entelect will be launching the next Refer A Developer in June this year.</p> <p> </p> <p>“The rules remain the same,” explains Williams. “We will be looking for the very best talent in the market and hoping to reward this person with an exciting overseas trip.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Dev Day 2017</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the latest Entelect Dev Day,  the day opened with Shashi Hansjee and Tomislav Ravic launching the new and updated company values under the banner, Become More. The updated values reflect the culture of the people who work at Entelect; always striving to improve, challenge the status quo, and building some really strong relationships on the way. The values were playfully attached to iconic movies that was launched in a playfully intelligent movie mashup. </p> <p> </p> <p>As we headed into Dev Day itself, a number of Entelectuals exhibited their tech passion-projects, and six delivered presentations on topics ranging from Kotlin to Container Orchestration with Kubernetes.</p> <p> </p> <p>The tech presentations were opened by Gail Shaw, who took us through ‘An exploration of non-traditional computer interfaces’. With an obligatory nod to Minority Report, she shared her own views on where non-traditional interfaces may end up, or not, in the future.</p> <p> </p> <p>Next up was Christoff Smith, with a talk on Kotlin, pitched as ‘ridding the world of NPEs and other Kotlin magic’.  Lawrence Puttergill presented a 20 minute lightening talk on Container Orchestration with Kubernetes, and Jesse Leresche took us through ‘All things Kafka’, sharing insights with us on Apache Kafka; the blazingly fast, open source streaming system that was open-sourced in 2011. Retief Fourie closed with Particle Effects with Unreal Engine 4 Cascade, telling us how to make our particle effects Unreal.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unexpectedly, the trickiest twitter question of the day, was presented by Enrique Geldenhuys in his talk on RegEx asking, ‘What does the first RegEx example do? /\.( {2,})[A-Z]/’</p> <p> </p> <p>After the presentations, employees took the time to hang out and interact with the demo’s on display.

            <title>Ryan Louw wins 2017 Entelect Challenge</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>Ryan Louw, a software developer by profession, was announced as the winner of this year’s <a href="https://challenge.entelect.co.za/">Entelect Challenge</a> competition, the finals of which were played out at rAge Expo on 7 October.</p> <p> </p> <p>Louw’s bot, ‘Colonel Panic’, built in C#, competed in all four rounds of this year’s Challenge and stormed to first place, winning him R70,000.</p> <p> </p> <p>Based on the hugely popular ‘Battleships’ classic game, the 2017 Entelect Challenge brought together novice coders and experienced professionals as they competed against each other by coding an artificial intelligence (AI) player, or bot, to challenge other bots.</p> <p> </p> <p>Coding and AI hobbyists and enthusiasts have spent the last six months building their bots, with the goal of winning their share of the R200,000 prize bounty.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The winning strategy</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Louw’s bot went into the finals with strong stats:</p> <p>• 196 wins out of 263 matches played;</p> <p>• 66,220 points won up to the final match; and</p> <p>• 5 wins out of 7 clan matches played</p> <p>“He had one of the strongest player strategies in the competition this year,” says Tomislav Ravic, Team Lead for the Entelect Challenge.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Competing successfully in the Challenge is not about the best or cleanest code,” says Ravic. “It’s all about the player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design but its strategy could be highly effective. That’s what makes the Entelect Challenge so appealing to coders of all levels.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Second place went to Dion van Huyssteen, who was awarded R35,000 in prize bounty. Van Huyssteen’s bot, ‘Heat Seeking bot’, built in C++, actually went into the finals with stronger stats than Louw’s bot: 228 wins out of 256 matches and a total of 73,310 points. But, on the day, Louw’s strategy was stronger.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>A word from the winners</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>This was the third time Louw competed in the Entelect Challenge. “My first Challenge was Pacman, then Space Invaders and now Battleships. For me, the best part of the Challenge is to get into the head of your opponent. My strategy this year was helped by the tournament stages; so first, I built a basic shooting strategy, then a weapons strategy, then, in the third round, I had to work out when to use the shield.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I figured out that I needed to place my bots statically in strategic locations and then I needed to start shooting from the outside-in, not the inside-out, as one would normally think to do.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I didn’t do very well in the first two rounds, so I wasn’t even expecting to get into the finals, but was really surprised to win,” says Louw. </p> <p> </p> <p>Second place winner, Van Huyssteen, describes his bot strategy: “I started with a standard heat-seeking strategy, but as the game went on, I started applying modifiers to that. The initial idea was to modify the heat maps with a bunch of variables, which I could iterate through and automate, but I ran out of time. So, I ended up with something that cleared the edges and then worked its way inwards after that.”</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Top awards all round</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Third place went to Anesu Jairosi, who says this was the third time he has entered the Challenge. “I hate losing, but I love coding so much, so I’ve entered three times now, since Pacman. This year, my strategy was based on probability, specifically where competitors will place their ships. But then I adapted this as I realised a human player will not place their ship in the middle, so I started aiming around the edges.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Fourth place winner, Jaco Mostert, said: “I’ve enjoyed every Challenge I’ve entered; it’s very entertaining just competing in the Challenge and having the chance to write the code. Personally, I don’t get a chance to do any AI in my job but it’s something I am interested in, so the Challenge allows me the opportunity to play with AI.</p> <p> </p> <p>“In the second battle, I focused on the side of the map, and gauged the performance and found my bot did a lot better. For the final battle, I scaled it down a bit to focus on the inside a little more but still with a good focus on the outside.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Sixth place went to Wynand Wolmarans, who won The Battle of Tortuga mini challenge. “I quickly realised that a great algorithm alone will not be enough to win the Challenge this year. I spent a lot of time tweaking and adjusting my bot but the most difficult part was choosing and sticking with a strategy because it could blow up in my face at any point. The secret to success is starting with a basic strategy, testing your bot against it and then letting your imagination take over.”</p> <p> </p> <p>The final rankings in the 2017 competition were as follows:</p> <p>1st         Ryan Louw                                        R70,000</p> <p>2nd        Dion van Huyssteen                           R35,000</p> <p>3rd         Anesu Jairosi                                     R25,000</p> <p>4th         Jaco Mostert                                      R25,000</p> <p>5th         Willie Theron                                     R10,000</p> <p>6th         Wynand Wolmarans                           R10,000</p> <p>7th         Andre Nel                                          R10,000</p> <p>8th         Mark-Anthony Fouche                        R10,000</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Not everyone has to be a coding wizard</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>This year, the competition was structured differently to allow relatively low-level coders the opportunity to enter. The team introduced four tournament battles, each one increasing the level of complexity.</p> <p> </p> <p>“The staggered strategy component that we introduced to the Challenge this year has been well received by the players, as it gives them a chance to refine and test their bots before entering the playoffs,” said Ravic. The result was an increase of more than double the number of participants than last year.</p> <p> </p> <p>“This year, the hackathons worked really well; people were not only recruiting and challenging others, but also helping others set up their bots. Thanks to these hackathons, participants were able to collaborate and compete on a whole new level. We’re looking forward to taking some of these concepts further next year,” concluded Ravic.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>LEGO’s Lars Silberbauer will be keynote speaker at Entelects year-end 2017 speaker series.</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[With a wealth of experience in digital media, Lars joined the team in 2011 and helped the company achieve explosive growth. In Danish, LEGO loosely translates to &quot;play well&quot; &amp; and is the foundation of their philosophy. By rethinking everything they do, LEGO has transformed itself in the eye of the consumer and Lars has been at the forefront of the latter part of this transformation. As recently as 2011, LEGO had absolutely no presence in social media, but under his stewardship, Lars moved it to one of the leading brands in the world on social media in just a few years. His approach is to constantly challenge the status quo. A great example of this being when he famously ran the $100 marketing campaign, forcing his team to think outside traditional marketing parameters. This approach has helped transform the LEGO brand at a time in its history when the brand was recuperating after near failure. Currently, Lars is taking the brand on another journey to reposition itself in the value chain, from block builder to much more. The 83-year-old Scandinavian company from Billund, Denmark, has survived factory fires, economic hardship during World War II, kept the company thriving through four family generations, and recovered from near bankruptcy in 2004. Nowadays, it is nothing less than iconic and an industry leader in innovative thinking. We are looking forward to spending time with Lars and challenging our thinking about the status quo!]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Four conferences, three cities, two weeks!</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT/Dev Connections is a deep-dive technical conference offering 5 different tracks and over 250 sessions. The five tracks are Cloud & Data Center, Data Platform & Business Intelligence, Enterprise Collaboration, Enterprise Management, Mobility, & Security and Development & DevOps.</p>   <p>I initially submitted sessions to the conference with no expectation of being selected. They were looking for just 8 data platform speakers.</p>   <p>As such, I was rather surprised to receive acceptance letters.</p>   <p>The two sessions that I’m presenting are “Lies, damned lies and statistics”, and “What the Query Store Shows”.</p>   <p>The first discusses SQL Server’s statistics, what they are, why they exist and why they are essential to good query performance. The session will also cover necessary maintenance and the effects of inaccurate or outdated statistics.</p>   <p>The second session covers SQL Server 2016’s Query Store, showing how the Query Store can be used to identify query performance regressions, identify the highest resource-consuming queries in a database, identify per-query wait statistics and to even fix poorly performing queries.</p>   <p>And then, after all of that, it’s up to Portland for conference 2 of the trip.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The finale: PASS Summit</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days of course, it’s for the entire data platform, not just SQL Server. R, Python, Power BI, CosmosDB and more.</p>   <p>That doesn’t mean that SQL Server takes a back foot at the conference. There will be a large portion of the SQL Server Dev Team there, a bunch of SQL Server Customer Advisory Team, a pile of Customer Support Engineers and more.</p>   <p>The first two days are started by keynotes. Wednesday’s by Rohan Kumar on the hybrid data platform and Thursday’s by Rimma Nehme on globally distributed databases, specifically CosmosDB.</p>   <p>I’m presenting a single session at PASS Summit this year, last session on Friday afternoon. The session is on the new feature in SQL Server 2017, adaptive query plans. This feature enhances the compilation process so that some aspects of the plan are chosen after execution starts, or for the query to be executed in two phases. Both of these are a major departure from the old compilation/execution process, which was a one-way pipeline with no way for the execution engine to adapt to inefficient plans or bad estimations.</p>   <p>Until Friday, I intend to sit in some Powershell sessions, Python, R and CosmosDB, and catch up on the vast amount of changes that have occurred in the database world this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>More ‘High Flyers’ recorded at Entelect than ever before</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Deloitte survey measures the following workplace features; Accomplishment and Growth, Values and Culture, Care and Feedback, Fairness and Integrity. Notably participation in this survey shot up to 95% which is in itself a measure of employee engagement and the value this survey holds with the company’s employees.</p>   <p>As in 2016, Entelect again recorded an engagement index way above the benchmark. This index measures an organisations overall employee engagement level in terms of work related behaviours and discretionary effort. In 2017, Entelect’s engagement index was recorded at 80% compared to a benchmark of 68%.</p>   <p>Employees are asked a series of questions pertaining to their work environments and the top scores for Entelect in 2017, voted anonymously by the employees, were:</p>   <ol style="margin-left: 40px;"> <li>The work that I do gives me a feeling or personal accomplishment</li> <br /> <li>The people I work with let me know when I’ve done a good job</li> <br /> <li>I can identify with the values of this organisation</li> <br /> <li>This organisation makes an effort to retain the best people</li> <br />   </ol> <p>Interestingly, some of the sentiments that moved into the top scores this year include:</p>   <ul style="margin-left: 80px;"> <li>This organisation makes a real effort to give public recognition for achievements</li> <br /> <li>My ideas and opinions count</li> <br /> <li>The purpose of this organisation stretches beyond profit and business success</li> <br /> <li>My manager/immediate leader values my talents and the contribution that I make</li> <br />   </ul> <p>“We’re particularly pleased with these insights,” explained Tomislav Ravic. “At Entelect, we work hard to ensure our culture and brand resonates with the values of young and dynamic software engineers. These sentiments are exactly in line with the kind of workplace people are looking for these days.”</p>   <p>Perhaps most outstanding though, is that the vast majority of Entelect’s employees are highly engaged and 67% of Entelect’s employees are measured to be in the High Flyers category on the engagement matrix. The benchmark is 34%. Typically, those categorised as Highly Engaged see a purpose in the work they do and feel that they matter to their organisation. They have high levels of pride in the work they do and are optimistic receptive and enthusiastic.</p>   <p>“This reflects the culture and heart of our organisation,” says Ravic. “Daily, our employees award ‘Kudos’ points to each other on our internal platforms in acknowledgement of a good job well done. This has created a positive culture driving purpose and achievement, and we’re really happy to see it come through in the Deloitte survey.”</p>   <p>Ultimately, the management team at Entelect know that these results are only possible because of the passion and effort each team member contributes every day. “Seeing such great scores across categories such as Accomplishment and Growth is because the employees themselves work hard to create a positive environment for their fellow employees.” Says Ravic.</p>   <p>Entelect’s company values are; Growth isn’t optional, Get things done, and Relationships and collaboration sets us apart.</p>   <p>“The results of this survey show us that our employees are living these values every day. This Platinum seal is testament to the culture that our employees are responsible for. This Platinum Seal goes to every member of Entelect who go above and beyond every day,” concludes Ravic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[Entelect awarded Platinum Seal of Achievement in 2017 Deloitte Best Company Survey.<br><br> For the fourth year in a row, Deloitte has awarded Entelect Software the highest honour achievable (Platinum status) for Achievement in its Best Company Survey. This latest award serves to confirm the continued strength of the organisations’ workplace culture and affirms that Entelect is always striving to enhance the working environment for its people.<br>]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Entelect at Dev Week, San Francisco, USA.</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>1. Was this your first time at Dev Week and did it meet your expectations?</strong></p> <p>Yes. It was the first time I attended Dev Week in San Fran and it was more or less what I expected: A huge conference and developer expo, where I had chance to meet many interesting developers and startups. </p> <p> </p> <p>It also happened to be the first time I gave a talk outside South African borders, which was pretty exciting.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>2. Your talk was on AI - tell us more</strong></p> <p>My talk was a primer on neural networks - a concept used in machine learning that tries to create intelligent machines by attempting to mimic how the human brain and nervous system works. This approach is used extensively in modern AI implementations and the aim of the talk was to demystify the intuition of how they work, how they're trained, and how they're designed. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. Which other talks did you attend and did anything blow your mind?</strong></p> <p>I particularly enjoyed two of the keynote talks:</p> <p> </p> <p>One by Jason Warner of Github titled "Building a Scalable Developer Culture". He spoke about how culture in a company (especially a tech company) needs to be organic and stem from leadership.</p> <p> </p> <p>The other was also about scaling. It was a talk by Bryan O'Sullivan of Facebook titled "Scaling Developer Tools and Teams". This talk gave some insight into the amount of time and effort Facebook put into optimising their development environment for more productive and happier developers. It also touched on some cultural aspects that Facebook cultivates for better development teams.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>4. You were also a judge at Dev Week’s Hackathon – tell us about the ideas and prototypes competing?</strong></p> <p>There were some very cool ideas, and there were some very practical ideas. Some of the teams wanted to build something that wouldn't necessary solve a burning need but allowed them to tinker with new technology and learn. Other teams decided to tackle a real-world problem using AI, Blockchain, AR, or IoT technology to name a few.</p> <p>The hackathon only allowed teams 24 hours to develop the solution. Given the time constraint, the teams that did best, were teams that focused on tackling a small part of the problem and prototyping it in the simplest way possible…</p> <p> </p> <p>One team tried to tackle the problem of slouching in front of your desk by using an Intel depth perception camera. They got a prototype working, and personally I appreciated that since slouching is a problem I try to fix as well. Another used Oculus Rift VR to make remote meetings more personal by placing people in the ‘same room’ using virtual and augmented reality.</p> <p> </p> <p>Another team created an open source JavaScript plugin for cryptocurrency websites to better standardise the way their charts represent currencies for better interaction by users. And another tinkered with IoT sensors to better measure the contents of physical containers and monitor it via a real-time dashboard. Lastly, a team created a map-based restaurant suggestion app with a twist - it only shows you the worst restaurants in a category!</p> <p> </p> <p>There were no rankings issued but various companies sponsored prize money and some categories included using an SDK from that company. Here is a list of the <a href="http://www.developerweek.com/developerweek-hackathon-winners/">winners</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>5. Tell us some things you’ll be bringing back to your dev teams in South Africa?</strong></p> <p>For one, I can say that South Africa has talented developers that are on par with Silicon Valley in terms of stature and the technology we use. I learnt a lot from talks I attended, but mostly from people I spoke to; I plan on ‘upping our game’ in terms of cultivating the development community in South Africa, and better scaling and growing our teams at Entelect.</p> <p> </p> <p>I've realised that the culture we have at Entelect is really special - something that can easily be compared to companies in Silicon Valley, and I'd like to take it beyond that. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Expanding to New Zealand</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /> Entelect grew internationally in 2017, kicking off operations in Wellington, and growing the New Zealand staff complement to over 10 in 2018. Setting up the branch in New Zealand not only opened up a new market for Entelect to grow into, but also created an opportunity for our people to live and work abroad. New Zealand has repeatedly been voted as one of the best countries to live in, especially due to the value Kiwis place on family life. Our value of ‘Growth isn't optional‘ has always been applied to everything that we do – whether growing our people through diverse and challenging projects, through our bi-annual reviews or our extensive internal training opportunities – and now the possibility of working abroad and experiencing new cultures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect to acquire a majority stake in Netherlands - based Fixx iT</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ShashiHansjee1.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Press Release</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><em><strong>The acquisition will accelerate Entelect’s global expansion, providing worldwide opportunities to staff and extend the reach of their service offering.</strong></em><br /> <br /> Entelect, South Africa’s leading software engineering and solutions company, has entered into an agreement to purchase a majority stake in Fixx iT, a software engineering and professional services company headquartered in Zeist, Netherlands. Along with Entelect New Zealand, this investment into Fixx iT continues the international expansion of the company and opens further opportunities for its customers, people and business by providing sought after skills, international exposure and the opportunity to broaden their service offering.<br /> <br /> “At Entelect, we believe that our culture of driving results for our customers and hiring the best people is one that can be produced on a global scale,” says Shashi Hansjee, CEO of Entelect. “With Fixx iT joining the Entelect family, we welcome an amazing group of developers and professionals who share our commitment to delivering the highest quality software engineered solutions and providing an environment for growth for our people.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Pending the completion of the purchase agreement, Entelect will take a controlling, majority stake of 87.5% of Fixx iT. Over time, Fixx iT will be rebranded to Entelect Europe, sharing the values and vision of Entelect South Africa, while combining the best of what has made both parties successful to date. Ronald Kuyper, the current owner of Fixx iT, will continue to assist in building the business in a part time capacity. “We expect the transition to be smooth as some of the software engineers at Fixx iT, are in fact South African” says Shashi Hansjee.</p> <p><br /> Through this purchase, Entelect is taking another step towards achieving its goal of becoming the world’s best software engineering and solutions company. The company continues to strive to prove that software development is not synonymous with non-delivery, and that it is possible to have a great culture without sacrificing delivery and customer satisfaction, while being both successful and doing good for people. “We want to lead the way in being different and making a difference” says Hansjee.<br /> <br /> This deal creates the opportunity to attract more foreign income into South Africa by connecting customers in Europe to the core team. It also gives Entelect people the opportunity to explore new cultures and experiences by transferring between offices and will give current and prospective customers access to global thinking and talent.<br /> <br /> “Our team at Fixx is extremely proud of what we’ve achieved since we launched in 2005, and we are excited to see what the future holds with Entelect,” says Fixx iT’s founder, Ronald Kuyper. “Their values completely align with ours and we look forward to embracing the Entelect mission, working together to serve our customer’s needs, and opening up growth opportunities for all our people across our office locations.”<br /> <br /> Globally, there is a growing need for enterprise software engineering services, including custom data solutions and experienced agile development teams, to create solutions that allow companies to serve the needs of their customers and their people.

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/EntelectChallenge2019-02copy.png" /></p> <p><br /> Worms, this years’ Entelect Challenge (https://challenge.entelect.co.za/) launches today. The event will run from the 17th of April, and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa (@AfricaComicCon) on the 21st September at 11am on the center stage. This year it is being held at the Gallagher Convention Centre.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Each year we look to build the Challenge around a popular game theme, and this year is “Worms,” says Rishal Hurbans, Team Lead, Entelect Challenge. “The idea behind the theme is not just to make it appealing to those of us who love gaming, but to also provide a game with simple enough rules that anyone with a basic understanding of programming can enter.”</p> <p> </p> <p>This year, we will again be running with a mini-playoffs series, a staggered strategy component.</p> <p> </p> <p>The mini-playoffs series will provide more opportunities for contestants to win. As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.</p> <p> </p> <p>There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in June, known as Early Bird Showdown and the second in July, called Modern Worm-fare, with the third one taking place in September, called Worm-ageddon. At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.</p> <p> </p> <p>The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, for instance, the ability to introduce new weapons or cloaking devices. Thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.</p> <p> </p> <p>This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the second time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!</p> <p> </p> <p>As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.</p> <p> </p> <p>“What a lot of people don’t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Prize money for this years’ event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place and third place will be awarded R25 000.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. “We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,” says Hurbans.</p> <p> </p> <p>Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different.  Machine learning is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed by focusing on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data.  By comparison, AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.</p> <p> </p> <p>While AI is seeing an exciting growth, Machine Learning is all around us and changing the way we live and work. There is no doubt that jobs of the future will rely on Machine Learning to a greater or lesser extent.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Entelect challenge shouldn’t be viewed as something that only super coding geeks can enter. This competition is designed for anyone with a basic level of programming who is interested in the world of machine learning and the future of software.</p> <p> </p> <p>This year we expect a wide variety of people from different backgrounds to enter which is going to make the player strategies really exciting. Who could win is anyone’s guess.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/HRAwards.jpg" /></p> <p><br /> Last night at the 5th annual Future of HR Awards, southern Africa’s most outstanding, inspiring and effective leaders in human capital management, HR innovation and HR tech were honoured.<br />  </p> <p>Entelect were announced the winner for Best Graduate Development Programme.<br />  </p> <p>Following the Future of HR Summit, the awards brought together CEOs, CTOs, HR directors and personnel from South Africa and beyond to celebrate and explore the hyper-responsive, agile workplace of the future. Having received a bevy of outstanding entries for both organisations and individuals, this year’s winners represent the very best of the best in the South African HR industry. <br />  </p> <p>The event seeks to celebrate industry leaders achieving exceptional standards of people management by showcasing strategies that make a direct impact on business performance. These innovative practices set new standards for the HR industry, reshaping HR into a cutting-edge strategic business component.<br />  </p> <p>Commenting on Entelect’s achievement last night, Sheldon Lyne said: “We are honoured to have received this award. Some of our Senior Managers, Team Leads, Tech Leads and Solutions Architects joined Entelect as Graduates – so taking in graduates is at the very core of who we are. This programme is one we have kept refining over the years, and we are proud that our industry-leading efforts in this space have been recognised.”</p> <p> </p> <p>For years Entelect has run South Africa’s leading Graduate programme.</p> <p><br /> We take on some of South Africa’s brightest young university graduates, who join us with a mix of engineering, science and commerce degrees. They get to participate in this training programme, structured to accelerate their careers – giving them a clear advantage over their university peers. It’s specifically designed to immerse Software Engineering and Business Analyst graduates into real-world software development. By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they would have been exposed to several languages and cutting-edge frameworks, which are actively being used in the industry.</p> <p><br /> <a href="https://theloreof.entelect.co.za" target="_blank">www.culture.entelect.co.za</a><br /> <a href="https://theloreof.entelect.co.za" target="_blank">https://theloreof.entelect.co.za</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Hear about what our previous graduates had to say about the Graduate Program in the videos below</p> <p> </p> <table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10" style="width: 800px;"> <tbody> <tr> <td><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGDP5Ji70u8" width="800"></iframe></td> </tr> <tr> <td><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5cvW62xCYM" width="800"></iframe></td> </tr> <tr> <td><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFdj4ahYgqg" width="800"></iframe></td> </tr> <tr> <td><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdWNRLXhvnE" width="800"></iframe></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Willie Theron wins the 2019 Entelect Challenge</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/EntelectChallengeBanner.png" style="width: 800px; height: 420px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Willie Theron, the founder of CyberDevs, and a web developer by profession was announced as the winner of this year’s Entelect Challenge. The finals were played out at Comic Con Africa on the 21st of September with hundreds of fans supporting.</p> <p><br /> Theron’s bot, ‘Metamorp’, built in JavaScript, competed in all four rounds of this year’s Challenge and stormed to first place, winning him R70,000. Willie has been entering the Entelect Challenge for years and was thrilled to finally come out on top!</p> <p> </p> <p>Based on the hugely popular classic ‘Worms’ game, the 2019 Entelect Challenge brought together novice coders and experienced professionals as they competed against each other by coding an artificial intelligence (AI) player, or bot, to challenge other bots.</p> <p> </p> <p>Coding and AI hobbyists and enthusiasts have spent the last six months building their bots, with the goal of winning their share of the R200,000 prize bounty.</p> <p><br /> <strong>The winning strategy</strong></p> <p><br /> Theron’s bot went into the finals with strong stats:</p> <p><br /> • 121 wins out of 125 matches played; and<br /> • 284,915 points won up to the final match;</p> <p><br /> “He had one of the strongest player strategies in the competition this year,” says Renette Ros and Edwin Fullard, Project Leads for the Entelect Challenge.</p> <p>“Competing successfully in the Challenge is not just about the best code,” says Entelect’s Marketing Manager, Bianca McFadyen. “It’s about the players’ strategies. Your bot may be really simple in its design but its strategy could be highly effective. That’s what makes the Entelect Challenge so appealing to coders of all levels.”</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The final rankings in the 2019 Worms competition were as follows:</strong></p> <p> </p> <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="width: 300px !important;"> <tbody> <tr> <td>1st</td> <td>Willie Theron</td> <td>R70,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2nd</td> <td>Marvin Thobejane  </td> <td>R35,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3rd</td> <td>Jean-Paul Conceicao</td> <td>R25,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4th</td> <td>Andre Makaal</td> <td>R25,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5th</td> <td>Mallin Moolman</td> <td>R10,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6th</td> <td>Gawie Jooste</td> <td>R10,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7th</td> <td>Leon Wessels </td> <td>R10,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8th</td> <td>Riaan Nel</td> <td>R10,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>                                                                                                                                      </p> <p><strong>Not everyone has to be a coding wizard</strong></p> <p><br /> This year, the competition ran the same to allow relatively low-level coders the opportunity to enter. There were three tournament battles, each one increasing the level of complexity.</p> <p><br /> “The staggered strategy component that we introduced to the Challenge continues to be well received by the players, as it gives them a chance to refine and test their bots before entering the playoffs,” said McFadyen.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>About Entelect</strong></p> <p><br /> We are a tribe of technology professionals who appreciate the skills we bring to the table, help grow each other, deliver awesome solutions using best practices and have a good time doing it.</p> <p><br /> <strong>About the Entelect Challenge University Cup</strong></p> <p><br /> The Entelect Challenge University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem.</p> <p><br /> We have created this unique initiative specifically for students as we noticed that there is a lot of interest in the main challenge but time commitments can be problematic given academic schedules.</p> <p><br /> We hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>DevDay 2019 – hosted in two cities twice a year!</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ImageHeader.png" style="width: 577px; height: 211px;" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>DevDay 2019 – hosted in two cities twice a year!</strong></p> <p><br /> DevDay is an in-house technology conference organised, presented and attended by Entelect’s own people where the technologist, inventor, hobbyist, engineer or artist in you can come to the fore. The event is part showcase, part science show, part geek club, part makers club; offering a range of lightning talks on cutting-edge technologies, as well as a variety of interactive exhibition stands where people can discover the latest creative innovations in technology.</p> <p><br /> The first event took place in 2014, and as the company has continued to grow, so has our conference. DevDay 2019 celebrated its fifth birthday and is now hosted twice a year in both our Western Cape and Gauteng offices, with over 550 people in attendance. Our next steps would be to replicate this conference in our European and New Zealand offices.<br /> The topics this year were better than ever, and catered for all our engineers and also our non-technical people. A few of the presentations included:</p> <p><br /> •    How to be a 10x ninja rockstar developer<br /> •    Mentoring and influence<br /> •    An image is worth 1000px<br /> •    Going passwordless<br /> •    Driving design convergence using web components</p> <p><br /> Our Tech Accelerator judging also takes place during DevDay, as well as a bit of competitive game jamming in the middle of the show. The Tech Accelerator is a platform to work on pet projects. Pet projects can be incubators to new businesses, social initiatives or even just building something as an excuse to play around with cool new tech. Projects are completed over the year, and during that time we host a series of hackathons where the pizza flows, ideas are shared, projects are accelerated, and trolls are attacked with Nerf guns.</p> <p><br /> The point of the Tech Accelerator is to learn, so the idea and IP belongs to the participants and not Entelect. The projects are evaluated on several categories such as technical innovation, cool factor and utility.</p> <p> </p> <p>We’re already looking forward to all our next events in 2020!</p> <p><br /> Watch our DevDay video at <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/stories/entelect-devday/" target="_blank">https://culture.entelect.co.za/stories/entelect-devday/</a></p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/CompanyPic.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" /></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

              <excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[DevDay is an in-house technology conference organised, presented and attended by Entelect’s own people where the technologist, inventor, hobbyist, engineer or artist in you can come to the fore. The event is part showcase, part science show, part geek club, part makers club; offering a range of lightning talks on cutting-edge technologies, as well as a variety of interactive exhibition stands where people can discover the latest creative innovations in technology.]]></excerpt:encoded>

            <title>Google Hash Code and the Entelect Hubs</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Preferred_1colour_rev.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Google Hash Code and the Entelect Hubs</strong></p> <p><br /> For the past few years, Entelect has supported and participated in Hash Code, Google’s annual coding competition. We set up hubs in our Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town offices, and we have Entelectuals participating in the competition every year. Hash Code is a fun challenge aimed at everyone that is 16 years and older, and is open to engineers at any skill level.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What is Hash Code?</strong><br /> Hash Code is Google’s team-based programming competition that allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modelled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world tackle the first problem through an Online Qualification Round. Although this round is hosted online, teams can come together to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code hubs. This is where Entelect plays a part – we create these hubs for teams to get together and collaborate. The top teams from this round are invited to join at an international Google office for the final round.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Join a hub</strong><br /> Entelect host hubs at all our South African offices for the online qualification round of Hash Code. Remember, this is a relaxed competition where you DON’T need to be a wizard of AI to participate! The prize money is also well worth it, so get your teams together and register at one of our hubs below.</p> <p><br /> <strong>The qualification round</strong><br /> The online qualification round takes place on 20 February 2020 at 19:30 SAST and registered teams are invited to participate from one of our hubs. The hubs are available to anyone over the age of 16 and you don’t have to be an Entelectual to join. Top scoring teams from the online qualification round will then be invited to Google’s office to compete in the final round of the competition on the 25 April 2020.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Interested?</strong><br /> If you’re interested in joining one of our hubs, put together a team of 2-4 people and be sure that you all register individually on the <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/">Hash Code website</a>. You’ll then need to select your applicable hub from the list of hubs in the judge’s system:</p> <p><br /> •             Entelect JHB<br /> •             Entelect PTA<br /> •             Entelect CT</p> <p><br /> Registration closes on the 17th February, but space is limited so register soon. We hope to see as many of you at one of our hubs for some pizza and collaboration!</p> <p><br /> For more information on this event at Entelect, visit <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/events-calendar/">https://culture.entelect.co.za/events-calendar/</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The 2020 Entelect Challenge Launches</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXWoGjYkZmY" width="700"></iframe> <p> </p> <p>Overdrive, this years’ Entelect Challenge (<a href="https://challenge.entelect.co.za/">https://challenge.entelect.co.za/</a>) launches today. The event will run from the 19th of March, and the finals will take place at Comic Con Africa (@AfricaComicCon) on the 26th September at 11am on the center stage. This year it is again being held at the Gallagher Convention Centre.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Each year we look to build the Challenge around a popular game theme, and this year is “Overdrive,” says Bianca McFadyen, Marketing Manager, Entelect. “The idea behind the theme is not just to make it appealing to those of us who love gaming, but to also provide a game with simple enough rules that anyone with a basic understanding of programming can enter.”</p> <p> </p> <p>This year, we will be running with a mini-playoffs series, a staggered strategy component.</p> <p> </p> <p>The mini-playoffs series will provide more opportunities for contestants to win. As per last year, the contestants get the opportunity to win a golden ticket in each of the first two mini-playoffs and in the third mini-playoff the top six will win a golden ticket. This makes up the final eight that will compete at Comic Con in the final event.</p> <p> </p> <p>There will be 3 mini-playoffs during the year. The first will be in May, known as Box Carting and the second in June, called The Furious and the Fast 42, with the third one taking place in August, called Vrrrpa! Wanna dice chaana? At these playoffs, contestants will be able to pitch their bots against one another in a Round-Robin format.</p> <p> </p> <p>The phases are designed to help contestants see how their bot is fairing. After each playoff event, a new strategy component will be launched, thereby upping the competition by adding in more bot strategies.</p> <p> </p> <p>This year the Entelect Challenge University cup will be hosted for the third time. The University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. With it we hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!</p> <p> </p> <p>As before the Player Portal will be available to contestants to test their bots, and the community forum for contestants to chat about their builds and discuss ideas.</p> <p> </p> <p>“What a lot of people don’t realize is that competing successfully in the Entelect Challenge is not about having the smartest, most supersonic bot. It is actually all about player strategies. Your bot may be really simple in design, but its strategy could be highly effective.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Prize money for this years’ event is R200 000 which will be divided across the mini-playoffs series and finals, with the biggest component awarded at the Finals at Comic Con Africa. First prize will be R70 000, R35 000 will go to second place, third and fourth place will be awarded R25 000 and 5th place is R10 000.</p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect runs the Challenge every year as a fun way to bring the software community together, but also to demystify the world of coding and AI. “We want as many people to enter this competition as possible and discover a whole new world of machine learning and AI,” says McFadyen.</p> <p> </p> <p>Machine learning is a term that is often used interchangeably with AI but they are actually very different.  Machine learning is a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed by focusing on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data.  By comparison, AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.</p> <p> </p> <p>While AI is seeing an exciting growth, Machine Learning is all around us and changing the way we live and work. There is no doubt that jobs of the future will rely on Machine Learning to a greater or lesser extent.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The Entelect challenge shouldn’t be viewed as something that only super coding geeks can enter. This competition is designed for anyone with a basic level of programming who is interested in the world of machine learning and the future of software.</p> <p> </p> <p>This year we expect a wide variety of people from different backgrounds to enter which is going to make the player strategies really exciting. Who could win is anyone’s guess?</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://challenge.entelect.co.za/">https://challenge.entelect.co.za/</a></p> <p><a href="https://challenge.entelect.co.za/">https://forum.entelect.co.za/c/entelect-challenge-2020</a></p> <p><a href="https://challenge.entelect.co.za/">https://culture.entelect.co.za/</a></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Entelect’s Tech Accelerator Programme</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/TechAcceleratorLogoSml.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>The Entelect Tech Accelerator is a platform for our people to work on pet projects. Pet projects can be anything from incubators to new businesses, social initiatives or even just building something as an excuse to play around with cool new tech!</p> <p><br /> We allocate eight hours a month to work on pet projects, sponsor a budget for any hardware or tooling (R2000 per person on the team) and assign Tech Lead time to each project.</p> <p><br /> The programme runs each year and signing up is as simple as pitching an idea and letting the Project Leads know the tooling, hardware and infrastructure required. Projects are completed over the year, and during that time we host a series of hackathons where the pizza flows, friends are made, ideas are shared, projects are accelerated, and trolls are attacked with Nerf guns.</p> <p><br /> The point of the Entelect Tech Accelerator is to learn and grow, so the idea and IP belongs to the participants and not Entelect.</p> <p><br /> The Tech Accelerator culminates in a yearend event (which is sometimes off the back of our second DevDay) where projects are showcased and judged by all competitors, fellow Entelectuals, and the greater Leadership Team.  The projects are evaluated on several categories such as technical innovation, cool factor and utility. Don’t worry, it’s not a serious event but simply a fun gathering where people show off their achievements.</p> <p><br /> This year, we have adapted and will be running it a little differently. We will be hosting the first event as a digital hackathon.</p> <p><br /> The judges scores are tallied, and the winners are announced at the yearend function (for bragging rights of course). Prizes are anything from drones and 3-D printers to cold, hard cash.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a class="button-box2 button-box" href="https://www.culture.entelect.co.za">www.culture.entelect.co.za </a></p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>2021 Entelect graduate applications are open after this year’s Boot Camp class graduates</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Graduate applications are open for 2021</strong></p> <p>After a challenging two months, our current 64 graduates made it through Entelect’s 2020 Boot Camp. This programme has been running at Entelect for several years and was developed to escalate all our graduates’ technical careers. If you are interested in joining Entelect’s 2021 Graduate Programme and being part of our Boot Camp visit <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now">https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>What happens before our Boot Camp kicks off?</strong><br /> The most anticipated initiative of the Entelect Graduate Programme are the highly successful open days for upcoming university graduates, held at our offices in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg and Century City, Cape Town.  Our Open Days are by invite only and are open to graduates we have either met and communicated with at Career Days, or who have reached out to us, by applying for graduate roles via <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/position/graduate/">https://culture.entelect.co.za/position/graduate/</a> and who have met our minimum requirements. The main objective of our Open Days is for students to gain a better understanding of the software industry, our company and to get better insights and advice on how to enter the job market. The Entelect leadership and management teams attend every Open Day and students get a chance to meet and ask questions from our CEO, Delivery Managers, Account Managers, Solution Architects and previous graduates.<br /> <br /> Because of the overwhelming response from students all over the country to attend these Open Days, this year, we have taken the stance of having these days more often and we hope to kick off the first remote Open Day soon. Our graduate intake for 2021 promises to be very strong and due to our Vacation Work Programme we have already offered several graduates roles for next year.</p> <p><br /> <strong>What is the Entelect Graduate Boot Camp programme?</strong><br /> Each year, we appoint some of the top BSc Computer Science, Engineering and BCom Information Systems graduates from all mainstream universities around the country for our graduate Boot Camp. These graduates start out as full-time Entelect employees, but first complete two months of training and upskilling during our Boot Camp. After completing the Boot Camp programme, the graduates get to work on client or internal projects under the mentorship of our team and technical leads.</p> <p>Our clients benefit as they get to work with the country’s top graduates who have escalated their technical careers through the programme, while our seniors also benefit personally from helping or people in the specialist areas that they are most passionate about.</p> <p> </p> <p>Boot Camp covers both the practical and theoretical side of end-to-end technology solutions. All graduates work through this full syllabus, regardless of which solutions stream they will be working on, giving them a rounded understanding of the full software development lifecycle. By the time the graduates have moved through the programme, they will have collaborated to write components of systems in various languages and platforms, all of which would have been vetted and code-reviewed by various technical leads.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Why do we run this programme?</strong><br /> Entelect’s client base are among the best blue-chip corporates in South Africa. Their appetite for the development of big bespoke systems that differentiate them in the marketplace keeps climbing, hence the demand for talented software engineers. Our extensive training and mentorship programmes are a real differentiator for Entelectuals. Our culture of continuous learning and growing our people is something that is instilled throughout the company.<br /> <br /> There is still a severe shortage of high-end software engineering skills in South Africa. This is why we believe investing in quality software engineering training programmes is a global priority.</p> <p><br /> When building software, engineers need to consider issues such as maintainability, quality, stability, performance, consistent standards, security, and scalability. To build a perfect solution requires the engineer to do all these things in parallel, which is true craftsmanship and takes years of experience.  It requires significant thought to be applied to the architecture and design, the ability to apply computer science principles and a strong problem-solving ability. As such, mastering the skills required to deliver great software is a highly adapted talent.<br /> <br /> The Entelect Graduate Boot Camp Programme was created to help build great software engineers, who can solve the toughest problems, deliver quality software using best practises, and who are supported by our other 650 top engineers all over the world.<br /> <br />  </p> <p><a class="button-box2 button-box" href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/apply-now/">Apply Now</a><br />  </p>   <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/Grads2020.jpg" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Scott Hanselman speaks at Entelect’s International DevDay</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/ScottHanselman-DevDay_Bannercopy5.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>This year, due to social distancing requirements, we took our annual internal technology conference online! Every Entelect office across the globe joined in to have some fun while learning from their fellow peers.</p> <p><br /> We kept the traditional elements alive by having a milkshake competition at intermission, our usual Twitter competitions ran throughout the day, and we held a ‘Suit Up’ challenge for the best dressed Entelectual on the day.</p> <p><br /> But the best surprise of all, which we had kept secret, was the announcement of our international guest speaker, Scott Hanselman. Scott needed no introduction for those in the world of tech.</p> <p><br /> Scott is a web developer who has been <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">blogging </a>for over a decade. He works in Open Source on ASP.NET and the Azure Cloud for Microsoft out of his home office in Portland, Oregon. Scott has three podcasts, <a href="https://hanselminutes.com/" target="_blank">Hanselminutes</a> for tech talk, <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/" target="_blank">The Developer’s Life</a> for commentary on what developers love, and <a href="https://ratchetandthegeek.simplecast.com/">Ratchet and the Geek</a> for pop culture and tech media.</p> <p><br /> Scott talked about “Using Windows to develop for Windows, Linux, or anything!” Not only was his talk extremely insightful, but also one of the most engaging virtual talks that we’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. It was also a personal experience, as he brought us into his home, showed us around his cool setup and gave us a few tips of how we could set up our own WFH spaces.</p> <p> </p> <p>Scott asked that we only sponsor a local community group that assist people to learn how to code in exchange for being our guest speaker on the day. We donated to GirlCode on his behalf, and will be assisting several girls in a boot camp this year to teach them how to code.</p> <p><br /> DevDay is an in-house technology conference organised, presented and attended by Entelect’s own people where the technologist, inventor, hobbyist, engineer, or artist in you can come to the fore. The event is part showcase, part science show, part geek club, part makers club; offering a range of lightning talks on cutting-edge technologies, as well as a variety of interactive exhibition stands where people can discover the latest creative innovations in technology.</p> <p><br /> The first event took place 6 years ago, and as the company has continued to grow, so has our conference. DevDay is now hosted twice a year in both our Western Cape and Gauteng offices, with over 750 people in attendance. Our next steps would be to replicate this conference in our European and New Zealand offices once it is responsible to do so – and we hope to see this in play in 2021.</p> <p><br /> Watch our DevDay video at <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/stories/entelect-devday/" target="_blank">https://culture.entelect.co.za/stories/entelect-devday/</a> and become more®</p> <p><br /> <strong>About Scott Hanselman</strong><br /> My name is Scott Hanselman.

            <title>Troy Hunt speaks at Entelect’s global DevDay</title>

              <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/TroyHunt-DevDay_Bannercopy5.png" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Entelect hosted its second online internal technology conference  for the year – DevDay. We decided to keep it online in order for us to keep our people safe, and because we have been successfully working remotely over the last seven months.</p> <p><br /> With our new tradition established in 2020, we kept our international guest speaker a surprise. We announced Troy Hunt upfront as he kicked off the event, and no surprise here, but the crowd was blown away. Troy is well-known in the world of tech and security and needed little introduction.</p> <p><br /> Troy, who founded the "Have I Been Pwned" website, is a Microsoft Regional Director and MVP who travels the world speaking at events and training technology professionals.</p> <p> </p> <p>Troy spoke about cyber security, focusing on password security, vulnerabilities in code when developing, and data breaches. He truly personalised his talk to the audience by using examples of South African data breaches. Not only was his talk extremely insightful, but his knowledge on all things security was appreciated.</p> <p> </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.myactive.co.za/wm-462416-cmsimages/TroyHuntquote-15.png" style="width: 100%;" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Troy chatted about Entelect’s culture on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfeBEwzWlao&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">weekly podcast</a>, and mentioned how he would love for his son to work at a company like ours after reading <a href="https://theloreof.entelect.co.za/" target="_blank">The Lore of Entelect</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>What our people had this to say about Troy and his presentation:</p> <ul> <li>‘I enjoyed how his approach was full of humour, kept me glued to my screen for the full duration!’</li> <li>‘It was just awesome to gain insight into data security from the master.’</li> <li>‘I found the talk to be very interesting, especially since it related to events in our country. Troy raised some good points around security in applications that we develop’</li> <li>‘I enjoyed his extensive knowledge in his field as well as the easy and pragmatic way he made it real and applicable to us. His enthusiasm was well received, and his accent was quirky.’</li> <li>‘Dude! It's TROY HUNT!’</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>All Entelect offices across South Africa, New Zealand and The Netherlands joined in on the day, and we had Twitter competitions and spot prize giveaways throughout.</p> <p><br /> DevDay is an in-house technology conference organised, presented and attended by Entelect’s own people where the technologist, inventor, hobbyist, engineer, or artist in you can come to the fore. The event is part showcase, part science show, part geek club, part makers club; offering a range of lightning talks on cutting-edge technologies, as well as a variety of interactive exhibition stands where people can discover the latest creative innovations in technology.<br /> The first event took place 6 years ago, and as the company has continued to grow, so has our conference.

Our next steps would be to replicate this conference in our European and New Zealand offices once it is responsible to do so – and we hope to see this in play in 2021.</p> <p><br /> Watch our DevDay video at <a href="https://culture.entelect.co.za/stories/entelect-devday/">https://culture.entelect.co.za/stories/entelect-devday/</a></p> <p><br /> <strong>About Troy Hunt</strong><br /> I'm Troy Hunt, an Australian Microsoft Regional Director and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Developer Security. I don't work for Microsoft, but they're kind enough to recognise my community contributions by way of their award programs which I've been a part of since 2011. You'll regularly find me in the press talking about security and even testifying before US Congress on the impact of data breaches.</p> <p><br /> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">https://www.troyhunt.com/</a></p> <p><br /> You can also find Troy on Twitter and Instagram</p> <p><br /> <strong>About Entelect</strong><br /> Entelect understands the true impact that non-delivery has on reputation and in the form of missed opportunities.
