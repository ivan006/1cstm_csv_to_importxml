REVAMPING ALLAN GRAY’S FIND AN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISOR PLATFORM	Allan Gray’s Find An Independent Financial Advisor (FAIFA) service is to help potential investors find independent financial advisors offering tailored, holistic financial advice based on their specific requirements. Allan Gray already had a tool for advisors on their website, but it did not provide profile management or advanced searching.  Allan Gray engaged with Entelect to develop a single page application that fitted into their public facing website's corporate identity.  The new system allowed the user to provide basic information investment services required, preferred language and location. Based on this criteria, the FAIFA platform matched the user with advisors.   Following the engagement, the investor fills in a summary questionnaire on the advisor. Allan Gray aggregates this data, and reviews and manages the advisor profiles to ensure advisor profiles are updated.
